<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The beautiful scenery of the Moselle has too long been
left without notice. It is true, some of our Artists have presented to
us scenes on the banks of this river; but English travellers are, for
the most part, ignorant how very charming and eminently picturesque are
the shores of this lovely stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rhine! the Rhine!&rdquo; is quoted by every one, and
admired or abused at every fireside, but the Moselle is almost wholly
unexplored. Lying, as she does, within a district absolutely overrun
with summer-tourists, it is altogether inexplicable that a river
presenting scenery unsurpassed in Europe should be so neglected by
those who in thousands pass the mouth of her stream. When the Roman
Poet Ausonius visited Germany, it was not the Rhine, but the Moselle
which most pleased him; and although glorious Italy was his home, yet
he could spare time to explore the Moselle, and extol the loveliness of
her waters in a most eloquent poem. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e225" href="#xd21e225" name="xd21e225">x</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Moselle, which rises among the wooded mountains of the
Department des Vosges, never during its whole course is otherwise than
beautiful. Below Tr&egrave;ves it passes between the Eifel and Hunsruck
ranges of mountains, which attain to the height of ten or twelve
hundred feet above the level of the river.</p>
<p>In the Thirty Years&rsquo; War the Moselle country suffered severely
from the ravages of the different armies; but there still remain on the
shores of this river more old castles and ruins, and more curious old
houses, than can elsewhere be found in a like space in Europe.</p>
<p>Having in the following pages endeavoured to lay before English
readers the interesting scenery of the Moselle, I trust, that although
in summer my countrymen do not mount her stream, fearful, perhaps, of
discomfort; yet that by the fireside in winter the public will not
object to glide down the river, in the boat now ready for them to
embark in; and hoping that they will enjoy the reproduction of a tour
that afforded me so much pleasure,</p>

<p>At a short distance from Bussang, a little town in the Department
des Vosges in France, is the source of the Moselle; trickling through
the moss and stones that, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href=
"#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>together with fallen leaves, strew the
ground, come the first few drops of this beautiful river.</p>
<p>A few yards lower down the hill-side, these drops are received into
a little pool of fairy dimensions; this tiny pool of fresh sweet water
is surrounded by mossy stones, wild garlic, ferns, little creepers of
many forms, and stems of trees.</p>
<p>The trees, principally pine, grow thickly over the whole ballon (as
the hills are here called); many are of great size; they shut out the
heat of the sun, and clothe the earth with tremulous
shadows&mdash;tremulous, because the broad but feathery ferns receive
bright rays, and waving to and fro in the gentle breeze give the
shadows an appearance of constant movement.</p>
<p>Here, then, O reader, let us pause and contemplate the birth-place
of our stream; leaving the world of stern reality, let us plunge
together into the grateful spring of sweet romance; and while the only
sounds of life that reach our ears are the rustling of the leaves, the
buzz of the great flies, the murmur of the Moselle, and the distant
ringing of the woodman&rsquo;s axe, let us return with Memory into the
past, and leaving even her behind, go back to those legendary days when
spirits purer than ourselves lived and gloried in that beautifully
created world which we are daily rendering all unfit for even the ideal
habitation of such spirits.</p>
<p>And reverie is not idleness; in hours like these we seem to see
before us, cleared from the mists of daily cares, the better path
through life&mdash;the broad straight path, not thorny and difficult,
as men are too prone to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3"
name="pb3">3</a>]</span>paint it, but strewed with those flowers and
shaded with those trees given by a beneficent Creator to be enjoyed
rightly by us earthly pilgrims.</p>
<p>Life is a pilgrimage indeed, but not a joyless one. While the whole
earth and sky teem with glory and beauty, are we to believe that these
things may not be enjoyed? Our conscience answers, No; rightly to
enjoy, and rightly to perform our duties, with thankfulness, and
praise, and love within our hearts, such is our part to perform, and
such the lesson we are taught by the fairy of the sweet Moselle.</p>

<h3 class="main">BIRTH OF THE MOSELLE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The fair Colline slept in sunshine, when from the far
horizon a rain-cloud saw her beauty, and with impetuous ardour rushing
through the sky he sought the gentle Colline, wooed her with soft
showers, and decked her with jewelled drops and bright fresh
flowers.</p>
<p>She soon learnt to love the rugged cloud, and from their union
sprang a bright streamlet which, cradled in its mother&rsquo;s lap,
reflected her sweet image. Then, as the time passed on, the little one
increased in strength, and leapt and danced about its mother&rsquo;s
knee. Larger and stronger grew the streamlet until its tripping step
became more firm, and then it passed into the valley, catching
reflections from the things around. And onward went this fairy stream,
her source watched over by a mother&rsquo;s love; and her cloud-father
fed her as she passed between her grassy banks. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then girlhood came, and sister streams flowed in, and, whispering to
her, told their little tales of life: so now, her mind enlarged, she
onward flows, sometimes reflecting on the things of earth, but oftener
expanding her pure bosom to catch the impress of the holy sky; and all
the tenants of the sky loved to impart their infinite beauties and
their glory to the pure stream.</p>
<p>The age of girlhood passes now away, and she becomes a fair maiden,
to gaze on whose beauties towers and cities, castles, spires, and
hills, come crowding, and line her path, each giving her the gift of
its own being.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e934width" id="p004"><img src="images/p004.jpg"
alt="" width="712" height="720"></div>
<p>Now come the mountains, too, with their crowns of forest waving on
their heads, and do homage to her beauty: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>she gives a sweet smile to
all, lingering at every turn to look back upon her friends; but yet she
tarries not, her duty leads her on,&mdash;nor worldly pomp, or pride,
or power, can keep her from her appointed path; she leaves them all
behind, and swelling onwards through the level plain, receives the
approving glance of heaven, and meets her noble husband Rhine, who,
long expecting, folds her in his arms. And thus her pilgrimage
complete, her duty ended, she calmly sleeps that happy sleep which
wakes only in eternity.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Such is the history of the birth and life of the Moselle. We have
now to wander from her birthplace here, in the Vosges mountains, to
where she joins her glorious husband Rhine beneath the walls of
Ehrenbreitstein. From time to time we shall linger by the roadside, to
pluck a flower from legendary lore; from time to time we shall stop to
secure a chip from the great rock of history: storing thus our herbal
and our sack as well as our portfolio, we shall follow the many
bendings of our graceful river, which, womanlike, moves gently and
caressingly along, soothing and gladdening all things.</p>
<p>The fairy and the river are as one, life within life; ever flowing
on, yet always present; ever young, and yet how old; ever springing
freshly mid the hills and woods, yet ever ending the appointed
course.</p>
<p>One life is material, earthly, but still sweet and beautiful; the
other life is born of the first, but far exceeds <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>it,&mdash;it
is the life poetic, whose other parent is the human mind: this life,
which leaves the parent life behind, floats upwards on its glorious
wings and reaches the highest realms of heaven, carrying with it the
souls of those who read this life aright&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Lying here beneath the pines, we recall those old days of the past
when, on the borders of our river, only forests waved, amid whose
depths tribes of wild warriors dwelt apart,&mdash;their only amusement
hunting, their only business war, they scorned to cultivate the soil
save for their actual necessities.</p>
<p>In this neighbourhood lived the Leuci, whose capital was Toul; lower
down, the Mediomatrices had their chief city, Metz; and beyond these
again came the Treviri, occupying the country about Tr&egrave;ves.</p>
<p>All these were members of that great German family which gave
sea-kings to Norway, conquerors to imperial Rome, and at a later day
that champion (Charles Martel) who stayed the tide of Moslem conquest
near Poitiers; thus Christianising half Europe, and probably saving all
earth from Mahomet&rsquo;s false creed.</p>
<p>Rugged and strong were these old Germans&mdash;the huge pines well
represent them; glorious in strength, stern in duty, upright, sombre,
and picturesquely magnificent: they are recorded as having been of
great size, with blue eyes and light hair, inured to every hardship,
and never laving aside their arms. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7"
href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>Owning no superior, yet when once they had elected a chief, and
raised him aloft upon their shields, they obeyed him implicitly; if
unsuccessful in battle they would kill themselves rather than survive,
believing that those who died on the battle-field were received by the
Walkyren, or heavenly maidens, who hovered over the fight and chose
lovers from the dying warriors.</p>
<p>What a picture of barbaric grandeur and indomitable will is given us
in the last act of one of their more northern naval heroes! Being
mortally wounded in a fight in which he had conquered his enemies, he
caused himself to be placed on board his vessel with the bodies of his
slain enemies around him, and all his plunder piled into a throne, on
which he sat,&mdash;then the sails were set, the pile was lighted, and
the blazing vessel putting out to sea, he sought his
heaven&mdash;Walhalla.</p>
<p>This Walhalla was supposed to contain a great battle-field, on which
the warriors fought their foes all day, receiving no hurt; and at
evening they returned to carouse and enjoy the caresses of the
Walkyren.</p>
<p>Of these immediate tribes, however, C&aelig;sar relates, that
&ldquo;they only worshipped the forms of the gods they could see and
whose beneficence they felt, such as the sun, moon, and fire; of others
they had never heard.&rdquo; Doubtless, in after days, they adopted
many of the Roman divinities, but at the time of which we speak they
adored their Creator on the mountain tops; and when Christianity was
introduced they built their churches on the tops of hills, and even now
the sacred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>edifices are usually placed on eminences. Some
remnant of the old hill-worship still remains, for the Mass is annually
read to the Sens shepherds on the Alps; and not long ago the Saint
John&rsquo;s fire was yearly lit upon the hill-tops.</p>
<p>Christmas was their most holy time; for then, they said, the gods
walked on earth.</p>
<p>The oak and the alder were objects of especial reverence; for from
the former man was made, and woman from the latter.</p>
<p>They considered all trees, and flowers, and plants, and stones, and
even animals, to be inhabited by beings of a superior order, who came
from an intermediate heaven and hell.</p>
<p>Lakes, rivers, and springs, were held in special veneration; and
Petrarch relates, that even in the fourteenth century the women at
Cologne bathed in the Rhine to wash away their sins.</p>
<p>Strangely in their natures were intermixed the gentle and the
savage, the cruel and the terrible, with the honourable and brave. Side
by side we find human sacrifices and a festival in honour of the first
violet; men who had been mutilated, and sickly children were sunk in
morasses, or otherwise destroyed; and we find them with a pure love for
woman, whom they held in the highest reverence. Their women were
brought up in the strictest seclusion, scarcely seeing any
stranger,&mdash;an injury offered to female modesty was punished by
death, and fines for injuries done to them were heavier than for those
to men. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>Maidens were portionless, so only married for their merits or their
beauty: they seldom married before their twentieth year, and the
husband had generally reached his thirtieth; they had but one husband,
and the historian Tacitus observes, speaking of them, &ldquo;as she can
have but one body and one life, so she can have but one
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prophetesses were frequent, and great confidence placed in their
predictions,&mdash;they were called Alrun&aelig;, and lived apart in
the recesses of the forests.</p>
<p>They had many ways of interpreting the will of the gods, but of all
interpreters the horse was considered the most sacred; white horses
were peculiarly venerated, and maintained at the expense of the
community, expressly to interpret the divine will,&mdash;even the
priests themselves considered that they were but the ministers, while
the horses were the confidants of the gods.</p>
<p>The priests, as in all semi-barbarous countries, were the real
governors of these uncurbed Germans: no control but theirs was
submitted to; even in camp they alone had the right to bind and flog,
and in all public assemblies they kept order: these functions they
assumed as ministers of the supreme, invisible Being. There was,
however, no priestly <i>caste</i>, and each head of a family could
perform religious offices for his own household.</p>
<p>Thus we find, at this earliest period of the known history of our
river&mdash;its banks occupied by a brave, hardy race, given to
dissipation and war, and governed by priests whose bloody sacrifices
were offered to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"
name="pb10">10</a>]</span>supreme Being, worshipped through His great
emblems of sun, fire, and water&mdash;they enjoyed a life of action,
and looked forward to a death of glory.</p>
<p>Under this rugged nature appear the gentler attributes of love and
veneration; and a belief in Fairies, Kobolds, Nixies, and all the
different classes of superior existences with which they supposed the
whole world to teem.</p>
<p>Savage and grand, loving and honourable, we shall, if we examine
history, find them first engaging the Romans on equal terms, then for a
while giving place to the conquerors of the world, but ever holding
themselves superior to them, not adopting their habits but merely
borrowing their knowledge to render themselves more fit to encounter
them; and finally, we shall find them supplanting these
world-conquerors, and seizing for themselves that crown and dominion,
the fairest portion of which remains with the German race to this
present day. And, moreover, it is this German race that has carried
civilisation over the whole earth, and whose descendants, the English
people, are rapidly populating the great continents of America and
Australia.</p>
<p>Back from the train of old history our thoughts return as the
evening closes in by the source of our sweet river, and we bend our
steps down through the dim woods. The white butterflies flap past,
heavily, as though feeling the last moments of their short lives are
fleeting fast; frequently above our heads starts out a projecting mass
of rock, from whose summit a great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11"
href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>pine towers up, first leaning
forward, then shooting upwards, its top seems piercing the blue
sky.</p>
<p>Ever and anon open out green dells, filled with bright foxgloves and
other beautiful flowers; through these dells trickle tiny rivulets that
swell the course of our young stream, which through the woods we hear
gurgling and gushing on, falling from stone to stone, and wearing many
a little pool in the rough ground.</p>
<p>Occasionally we pass a heap of fresh-cut wood, and across our path
lie huge trunks of the fallen forest giants; a resinous odour is
strongly mixed with the scent of the wild flowers,&mdash;one flower,
from which the mountain bees make their delicious honey, is peculiarly
fragrant and very frequent; occasionally the rivulet is quite hid by
the luxuriant carpets of the false forget-me-not that line its
banks.</p>
<p>At length we pass from the forest to the cultivated land: the little
valley opens into a wider one, which is surrounded by mountains of
diverse forms steeped in sunlight; the sun declines, and wreaths of
blue smoke ascend from the ch&acirc;lets on the hill-sides, where the
evening meal is being prepared for the active, hard-working peasantry,
who, with loads of all sorts on their heads, pass by, saluting politely
as they go us and each other.</p>
<p>The young stream dances along by the roadside, and thus we enter
Bussang, and close our first chapter of this fairy life. <span class=

<p>From Bussang to Remiremont our infant stream gurgles plashingly
along; sometimes it conceals itself in little tranquil pools, where the
large trout lie deep beneath the roots of the overshadowing trees;
sometimes it falls with a gentle splash over an obstruction, leaping,
as we do in early life, over all difficulties with a smile, even
seeming to enjoy that which at a maturer age too often frets and chafes
us, though we conceal our chagrin under an unruffled surface.</p>
<p>Sometimes our stream passes, broken into ripples, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>over
smooth shiny pebbles,&mdash;here the trout from time to time suddenly
dart up and seize their insect food; and sometimes it glides between
green banks which hem it in (fair setting for so bright a gem): here it
is blue, reflecting the sky above.</p>
<p>Through the sultry summer days, hours spent splashing in this little
stream, or dreaming on its banks, are most delicious,&mdash;but beware,

<p class="first">The scenery down the valley is altogether charming,
occasionally grand, but oftener sweetly beautiful; the hills are of
considerable height, some cultivated in patches of grain-crops, some
covered with trees, while others again are brightly green with turf,
except where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>grey rocks crop out and break the outline. Farther
off the large shadowy mountains rise, calmly shutting in the minor
hills, the valley, and the stream; the fleecy clouds float gently on,
and rest upon their summits.</p>
<p>Groups of trees half hide the houses which frequently appear within
the valley; the numerous bridges are generally of wood, some covered as
in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The peasant women, in great straw hats or little close caps, work
hard amidst the fields storing the hay crop; the oxen yoked together
munch their fill of sweet fresh grass, that has grown in the
well-watered meadows; round them the children play, piling the hay upon
each other until, overcome by the heat, they hasten off to bathe in our
cool stream.</p>
<p>Here, at a short distance above Remiremont, is the confluence of two
branches of our river; and river the Moselle now becomes. Leaving her
infant days she glides forth, with all the sunny joyousness of
girlhood, through the valleys of Remiremont and Epinal, then on through
the undulating plain, past Toul, to meet her confidant the Meurthe.</p>
<p>Remiremont is a well-built, clean town, with rivulets flowing
constantly on both sides the roadway; it contains a fine church, near
which are the buildings that formerly held the celebrated Dames de
Remiremont, of whom the following account is given.</p>
<p>In the seventh century a monk named Am&eacute; arrived at the court
of King Theodobert of Austrasia; moved <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>by his preaching, one of
the principal officers of the king, named Romaric, embraced the
monastic life, and gave an estate to found a monastery of nuns: the
mountain on which this monastery was built was called &ldquo;Mons
Romarici,&rdquo; hence the modern name of Remiremont.</p>
<p>A community of monks was established shortly after, near the
nunnery, and St. Am&eacute; governed both; he dying, Romaric succeeded
him: but now the female monastery was governed by an abbess,&mdash;it
is said, a daughter of Romaric.</p>
<p>To this monastery Charlemagne came to enjoy the pleasures of the
chase, and here the unhappy Waldrada, wife of Lothaire II., came to die
after her long persecution by the Church.</p>
<p>In the tenth century the Huns penetrated here, and ravaged the
monastery; a few years after it was totally destroyed by fire; after
this event it was rebuilt at the foot of the mountain: the two
communities now separated, the ladies entering on their new abode, and
the monks retiring to the mountain.</p>
<p>The ladies lived such scandalous lives that Pope Eugenius reproached
them with dishonouring the religious habit; his complaints were
useless, and the ladies soon threw off even the appearance of <i lang=
"fr">religieuses</i>, and remained bound together by a sort of female
feudality. The abbesses were people of the best families, and none were
admitted as members of the community but those who could prove
themselves of noble blood on both sides for two hundred years.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>The abbess ranked as a princess of the Empire, and held a feudal
court,&mdash;a drawn sword was carried before her by one of the
officers, of whom she had many in her service; she received her
investiture from the hands of the Emperor himself, and had many rights
over different parts of the surrounding country, her power often
clashing with that of the Dukes of Lorraine.</p>
<p>The Dukes were bound to appear before the monastery on the 15th of
July of each year, and to carry on their shoulders the shrine of St.
Romaric; they then signed, in a large book plated with gold and kept
for that purpose, a confirmation of all the privileges of the abbey. In
consideration of these services, however, they gained certain solid
advantages.</p>
<p>One of the most violent quarrels between &ldquo;les Dames&rdquo; and
the Dukes of Lorraine was owing to Duke Charles III. refusing to carry
the saint&rsquo;s relics on his shoulders; eventually the ladies gave
up the point on consideration of receiving, in lieu, an annuity of 400
francs.</p>
<p>In 1637 Duke Charles IV. besieged the town, which had been
garrisoned by the French with fifteen companies of the regiment of
Normandy. These soldiers being driven to extremity, declared, rather
than submit without conditions, they would burn the abbess, abbey, and
all the ladies, as well as the citizens; the ladies despatched six of
their number to the Duke, who, overcome by the tears of beauty, granted
an advantageous capitulation to the Norman rascals.</p>
<p>Next year Turenne appeared before the city, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>the Duke
had left feebly garrisoned; but the abbess, mindful of the Duke&rsquo;s
kindness, so stoutly defended it, that after three assaults Turenne
retired with considerable loss. After this the abbess obtained from the
French king a promise of neutrality.</p>
<p>The power of these extraordinary &ldquo;Dames de Remiremont&rdquo;
lasted (though somewhat shorn) until the tide of the French Revolution
swept away for a time even the name of the town, which was called
Libremont. The church and buildings still remain, the last remnants of
this extraordinary community.</p>
<p>Having climbed the hills above Remiremont and seated ourselves amid
the heather and ferns, the valley in folds of bright green extends
itself beneath; the hills around are varied and beautiful, clumps of
trees adorn the meadows, and great shadows steal along, presenting to
our eyes a constant succession of moving pictures.</p>
<p>One of these shadows we watch roll down the distant mountain-side,
leaving it bright and glowing with the grain,&mdash;then, coming
onwards, it rests upon a great clump of trees, whose contrasted
darkness lights up the grass beyond: they in their turn are left
behind, and, now quivering in light, they stand backed by the sombre
mountain wrapped in a succeeding veil; these clouds roll on, and others
quickly following, give to the valley an appearance similar to that of
a rolling prairie: now they approach, and envelope the hill on which we
sit in gloom; but shortly all again is clear, the sky above is pure,
the air is sweet; the meadows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=
"#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>glory in their abundance, and our
river, bending and turning, now to the far side of the valley, now
towards the town, freshens the heated herbage with its limpid
stream.</p>
<p>From the valley, beautiful though it be, we turn our eyes to the
more glorious beauty of the</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<h4>NOONDAY CLOUDS.</h4>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Over our heads the sunbeams quiver,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1037">The air is filled with heat and light,</p>
<p class="line">While at our feet the shining river</p>
<p class="line xd21e1037">Sparkles with thousand dimples bright.</p>

<p class="line">Which brightens our hearts, as sun does the stream.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Where we sit the ground is heaped into all sorts of
forms, and covered with ferns and heather,&mdash;from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>latter
rushes a large covey of whirring partridges, and swoops into the
valley.</p>
<p>Above, the still forest sends down its treasures of bark and
firewood, which are borne in creaking waggons down the steep ascent;
the oxen stagger beneath the weight, while the drivers shout
encouragement, and their great dogs look calmly from the overhanging
bank upon the busy scene.</p>
<p>All the environs of Remiremont are beautiful, and the town itself is
a favourable specimen of a French country town: it is much better paved
than those towns usually are, and the principal street has arcades
under the first floor, beneath whose shade it is pleasant to sit during
the midday heat, and hear the water rushing through the tiny
canals.</p>
<p>In the little busy inns people come and go rapidly, the fashionable
watering-place of Plombi&egrave;res being only some twelve miles
distant: the tables d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te at these inns are wonderful, the
number of dishes, the rapidity with which they are served, and the
really excellent cookery. Most of the diners are men, and they one and
all make love to the woman who, in conjunction with a lad, waits on
some twenty guests, and yet finds time to parry all their jokes with
sharp repartee.</p>
<p>Here may be seen a good specimen of the false politeness of the
French,&mdash;they never help themselves to the <i lang="fr">vin
ordinaire</i> without filling up their neighbour&rsquo;s glass, whether
he wants more or not, and they almost invariably pick out the choice
morsel from the dish which the aforesaid neighbour eyes with longing
looks: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>one, an epicure, reaches over you to secure the
oil and pepper, with which to make additions to some vile sauce he is
compounding for a coming dish; another <i>will</i> have something out
of its proper turn, which irritates the handmaid; all eat voraciously,
and with knives scoop up superfluous gravy, endangering the fair
proportions of their mouths. After dinner (which is at twelve), cards
and coffee fill the time until a little gentle exercise brings them to
a second dinner at seven, when the knives play their part again.</p>
<p>Travelling in the smaller diligences is very miserable, but the
little rattling carts that can be hired are worse and slower.
Journeying, again, brings out the <i>politeness</i> of the French
men,&mdash;who secure the best seats if possible, never giving them up
to ladies, and fill the vehicle with very bad tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>Leaving them to the smoke and dust, we will go down into the
meadows, and walk with our fresh river through the fields it waters on
its passage to the gay town of Epinal.</p>

<p>On a slight elevation at the entrance of the town is a public garden
of fine old beech-trees, that shade seats and walks; rough grass lawns
fill the intervening spaces. Here plays a military band on Sundays and
f&ecirc;te-days, and the young men sun themselves in the eyes of the
fair ladies, who in many-hued attire float up and down, ostensibly
listening to the military music, but really to that of the voices of
their admirers.</p>
<p>Here on all days play the children, and on the grass sit the
picturesquely-dressed nurses, with great bows in their hair and snowy
sleeves puffed out upon their arms. It is a pleasant lounge and of
considerable extent; on one side is the river, the main body of which
falls over a wear, while a portion of the water is conducted through
the town in a clear stream, which reunites itself with the main body
below the town: thus an island is formed, and Epinal stands on both
banks as well as on this island, several bridges joining the different
quarters.</p>
<p>There is near the end of the town a very beautiful old church; on
the hill above, was formerly a strong castle, only a few stones of
which now remain: the hill is covered by a private garden commanding
fine views.</p>
<p>Epinal is on the site of a very ancient town that was twice
destroyed by a fire and pillage; the modern town arose round the walls
of a monastery founded in 980 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> by a Bishop
of Metz, and enlarged in the following century.</p>
<p>The ladies of this monastery appear to have rivalled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>the
&ldquo;Dames de Remiremont&rdquo; in leading scandalous lives, if not
in power; and when, in the thirteenth century, a Bishop of Toul
undertook to re-establish the primitive rules among them, they refused
to take any vow, and ended by secularising themselves, but still kept
in some measure aloof from the world: they had two dresses, one for the
convent, the other for society. They existed as a community till last
century.</p>
<p>As a Bishop of Metz had founded this monastery, his successors
assumed the sovereignty of the town, and one of them, in the thirteenth
century, caused it to be fortified. This sovereignty was often disputed
by the townspeople on the one hand, and by certain seigneurs, who had
been declared guardians of the monastery, on the other: thus many
disputes arose; at last it was agreed that the town should be ceded to
the Dukes of Lorraine, and to this house it remained attached.</p>
<p>Frequently taken by the French, and as often retaken, it suffered
much from war, but was always constant to its ducal rulers until
Lorraine became finally incorporated in France. At the present day it
is bustling, dirty, thriving, and ill-paved.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>And now away, over the hills and valleys. The river swells on
beneath or past us, leaving Thaon, Ch&acirc;tel, Charmes, and many
other towns and villages behind; on it flows, falling over wears and
circling many islands, wearing its course along until it leaves the
Department des Vosges and enters on that of the Meurthe. <span class=

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pleasant land of France!&rdquo; sings the poet; and a
pleasant land it is, especially when, as now, the tall and yellow grain
is spreading over its fair plains. As we approach Toul the reapers are
at work; the women and children are busy binding or spreading out the
sheaves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>fast as the men can cut them,&mdash;all is gay and
happy; the sun glowing on the grain makes the whole land seem an El
Dorado, and we appear to move in one of the golden dreams of
fairyland.</p>
<p>Coming on our river again, which has serpentined along, loitering to
water those fruitful plains of &ldquo;old Lorraine,&rdquo; we find her
stream shrunk within its pebbly bed; for the sun has drunk from earth
her moisture, and the fire element rules now for the good of man, where
the water, moistening the earth, had produced the germ within her
bosom.</p>
<p>The contrast of the burning sun and corn makes our dear river seem
the cooler and the fresher. All down its course the bathers are wading
refreshingly about: in a side-stream, shaded by tall poplars and
guarded from eyes inquisitive by rows of piled-up firewood, bathe the
women, maids, and girls; in long loose dresses floating, with hair
wreathed lightly round their glistening heads, they toss the glittering
drops upon each other, and laugh, and scream, and sing: here,
hand-in-hand, with tottering gait, they struggle up against the stream,
slipping and tumbling at each forward step,&mdash;then, the desired
point reached, merrily they float down, and the blue tide sparkles with
their beauty. Upon the bank are some timidly adventuring their
hesitating feet before they plunge into the element; some bind their
hair, preparing; others, having bathed, unbind, and the long tresses
stream over the fair shoulders: blithely thus they pass the time, and
defy the hot old sun upon the river&rsquo;s bank. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>A little further, and the green slopes of the fortifications sweep
up, and the cathedral towers stand high above the invisible town;
beyond the towers is a great flat-topped hill, whose smaller brethren
stretch south-wards: in all, the same flatness of the summit is
perceptible.</p>
<p>The river makes a great bend after passing Toul; she seems to have
come so far, to see the old capital of the Leuci, and finding there
little to arrest her progress or detain her steps, she hastens off to
hear from her girlish friend, the Meurthe, the history of Nancy, whose
walls the latter guards.</p>
<p>Before we go with our Moselle to hear the tales of Nancy, we must
first listen to a simple story from French every-day life, near
Toul.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">AD&Egrave;LE AND GUSTAVE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once more War stalked the land; again France was
aiming, and calling on her sons to fight a foreign foe: but this time
her quarrel was a righteous one, for side by side with England she
appeared, to guard the weak against the oppression of the strong.</p>
<p>Ad&egrave;le&rsquo;s heart was beating with anxiety when the day for
drawing the fatal numbers had arrived,&mdash;those numbers that should
determine whether Gustave left her for the battle-field or remained to
marry, as had been agreed between them and their parents.</p>
<p>Gustave, however, though he dearly loved his sweet
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, loved more that empty trumpet glory, a grand
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>word, and one that chains the hearts of
men,&mdash;but, like the drum and trumpet, its appropriate adjuncts,
only expressing a hollow though a ringing sound.</p>
<p>Such was the glory Gustave dreamt of,&mdash;not true glory, not
heroism in daily life, not the dying in defence of what we
love,&mdash;but the rush and the glitter, the pomp and the pride, the
excitement and the turmoil of the imagined war.</p>
<p>Little thought he of the days of severe privation, the nights of
watching, the constant petty troubles, and the lingering pains brought
on by disease engendered by a soldier&rsquo;s life; and still less, it
is to be feared, did his mind dwell on the number of Ad&egrave;les this
ruthless war leaves mourning and trembling, while their husbands,
friends, and lovers, fight and die afar. He only thought of glory in
the abstract; perhaps also of a time when, a high grade won, triumphant
he should return and lay his spoil at Ad&egrave;le&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>And he was drawn; his friends begged him to let them purchase a
substitute,&mdash;he, with his ambition and his love for them combined,
would not allow that they should thus impoverish themselves; but, being
strongly urged, he turned to where Ad&egrave;le silently was grieving,
and left the choice to her.</p>
<p>Poor Ad&egrave;le, knowing well his secret heart, and fearing that
he would only fret and chafe at home,&mdash;perhaps, too, being herself
a little tainted with his love for glory,&mdash;wept, but said,
&ldquo;Go, then, dear Gustave; never shall a French girl counsel her
lover to desert his country.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28"
href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>So, while many a tear and secret prayer are poured out for his
welfare, Gustave goes.</p>
<p>The land rings with martial preparations; on all sides is the
excitement of the coming war: the eagles and the banners are raised
high; and all the air is filled with the grand anthem,
&ldquo;<span class="sc" lang="fr">Partant pour la
Syrie</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Part II.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Gustave wrote often: first he was learning his drill,
then he had finished his initiation and was in favour with his
superiors, often being able to assist with his clear head and ready
pen.</p>
<p>Soon after these, a letter came to say the regiment was to hasten to
Marseilles, there to embark for Eastern service.</p>
<p>A long silence, and a battle had been fought upon the plains of
Alma: his name was not in the lists of killed and wounded,&mdash;those
fearful lists that break the hearts of many; it is not those fighting,
but those left behind we ought to pity.</p>
<p>Then came a day of joy: Gustave had performed one of those daring
feats of which the Russian war gave so many instances,&mdash;he had
been promoted; and Ad&egrave;le&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, and her bosom
heaved, as friends came flocking in offering their congratulations.</p>
<p>The long winter was rolling on; still the enemy, with desperate
courage, defended the beleaguered city; and men died fast of fatigue,
and cold, and want, both within and without the walls. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>Gustave was strong and healthy, never sick or suffering; but, alas!
a day came when, after a night sortie gallantly repelled by the French,
who followed the enemy nearly into the very town, it was found that he
had not returned; and his men reported that he had fallen mortally
wounded close to the city walls: they had endeavoured to bring him off,
but the task was too difficult, and he was left to breathe his last
where he had fallen.</p>
<p>The Colonel himself wrote to his friends, and a decoration was
forwarded; but did those words of praise, did that cold cross, repay
Ad&egrave;le for her lost lover? Often, when no eye but that of God was
on her, she sat with these treasures in her lap, but from her eyes the
tears would flow, and the cross and words were dimly seen through the
descending drops,&mdash;no, Ad&egrave;le was not consoled, though he
had died for France; hollow were to her the words, &ldquo;<span class=

<p class="first">Peace was with the earth again; the dear-bought peace,
that found parents and children, wives and sisters, mourning for those
the war had snatched from their embrace.</p>
<p>Around the walls of Toul the harvest had been gathered; the last few
sheaves were loaded on the carts as the declining sun sank down; the
horses or oxen, gaily decked, moved slowly towards the city; round
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=

<p class="first">Ad&egrave;le entered not into their joy, her heart was
like her lover&mdash;dead. As they go with the last waggon towards home
suddenly a shout is heard&mdash;a crowd comes on&mdash;she hears her
name called&mdash;many voices seem to say
&ldquo;Gustave!&rdquo;&mdash;the crowd gives way.</p>
<p>Well-known eyes are looking into hers as she awakes to
consciousness&mdash;his arm is round her, and his heart is beating
against hers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=

<p>Alive, though grievously wounded, he had been taken care of by a
noble foe; and at the termination of the war, released, he had come
back; one empty sleeve was pinned against his breast, but there she
placed the cross,&mdash;he smiled fondly on her, but looking at it
sighed, thinking perchance glory may be bought too dear.</p>
<p>And now by the Moselle&rsquo;s banks Ad&egrave;le nurses her invalid
husband, and peace for the moment reigns in France. But, alas and alas!

<p>Toul contains little to detain us except its fine cathedral; it is
&ldquo;dullest of the dull,&rdquo; no movement in its streets; a
railroad hurries past her gates, but few of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>the
passengers enter them; her history alone is interesting: built before
history for this portion of the globe began, she was, when visited by
the Roman eagles, the capital of the warlike Leuci.</p>
<p>Erected at a very early period into a bishopric, its Bishops were
its rulers; nominally subject to these Bishops and the Counts of Toul,
the burghers seem actually to have enjoyed all the rights of a free
city, and eventually the town was reckoned one of the free Imperial
cities.</p>
<p>In a quarrel which arose between these burghers and their bishop,
Gilles de Sorcy, in the thirteenth century, three arbiters were named
to settle the dispute. It appeared, that formerly the townspeople had
been obliged to find food for the Bishop&rsquo;s table during the month
of April; this custom had fallen into disuse, but now Gilles claimed
arrears and its continuance: the burghers, in their turn, claimed
certain gifts from the Bishop on his entrance into the city.</p>
<p>It was agreed that the town should pay to the Bishop sixteen pounds,
money of Toul, each year; and he, on his part, was to distribute, on
his solemn entry into the city, forty measures of wine, eight hundred
pounds of bread, and an ox boiled (?) whole, with parsnips.</p>
<p>By this award it would appear that neither party had the upper hand,
but that the power was nearly equally divided.</p>
<p>At the death of Gilles dissensions broke out, and in <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 1300 the people placed themselves under the protection
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>of the King of France. Disputes now arose between
the French monarchs and the German emperors, as Toul was an Imperial
free city; but the French were the more active, and the city was
considered under their protection.</p>
<p>Occasionally the citizens had to be recalled to a sense of their
allegiance by burning their suburbs or occupying their town. Finally,
in the sixteenth century, Toul was formally ceded to France, and in
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1700 Louis XIV. pulled down the old walls,
and erected the fortifications within which the town now stagnates.</p>
<p>The great canal connecting the Rhine and Marne runs parallel with
the Moselle to Frouard, near which place the Meurthe falls in: the
country is pleasant, diversified by hill and dale, and richly
wooded.</p>
<p>Beyond Liverdun, railroad, road, canal, and river, run side by
side,&mdash;fire, earth, water, and air, all rendered thus subservient
to man.</p>
<p>And now the Meurthe runs in; full of gay confidence, this friend
imparts her knowledge to our stream.</p>
<p>She tells her of a city beautifully laid out with gardens of great
trees, beneath whose shade gay dames and damsels walk, while music
fills the air; hard by the numerous fountains play; and the old palace
of King Stanislas, who enriched the town with many a stately building,
is near. The shops and caf&eacute;s, the theatre and walks, all render
Nancy a cheerful and agreeable abode. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>Within the old town is the curious palace of the ancient Dukes,
containing a museum, where all sorts of relics are preserved.</p>
<p>Old towers stud the walls; and statues, groves, and churches
ornament the town: in the ducal chapel are the tombs of the Dukes of
Lorraine, who were powerful sovereign princes. This chapel is very
beautiful.</p>
<p>Nancy appears to have been at the height of its lustre during the
reign of Stanislas, who received the Duchy of Lorraine, in lieu of his
own kingdom of Poland, from the French monarch; at his death the duchy
finally reverted to France, and became extinct in 1766.</p>
<p>Stanislas and his queen, in 1699, took part in a very curious
ceremony called &ldquo;The F&ecirc;te des Brandons,&rdquo; annually
practised in Nancy.</p>
<p>This f&ecirc;te was thus conducted: on a certain day all the
newly-married couples, of whatever degree, were obliged, under pain of
penalty, to go out of the city gate and fetch a fagot; these fagots
were, to save them the trouble of going to the wood, sold to them
outside the gates, where a sort of fair was held, in which they
purchased ribands, pruning-knives of white wood, &amp;c.; they
returned, with their fagot bound with the ribands, and the husband with
one of the pruning-knives hanging to his button, to the Halle des Cerfs
in the ducal palace: from there they went in procession to the
market-place, and formed a pile with the fagots; they then inscribed
their names at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, in a book kept for that
purpose, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>and received certain privileges for the coming
year.</p>
<p>Returning to the palace, they danced in the court, and the young men
pelted peas under their feet; which &ldquo;being,&rdquo; says the
chronicler, &ldquo;very hard, occasioned the dancers many falls, which
caused great hilarity among the spectators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At seven in the evening they had a grand supper at the H&ocirc;tel
de Ville, and afterwards the bonfire was lit and fireworks sent up.</p>
<p>During the blazing of the bonfire the new-married had the right of
proclaiming from the balcony of the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, &ldquo;Les
Valentins et les Valentines,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> they called out the
names of any of their unmarried friends with the following words,
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Qui donne-t-on &agrave;
M&mdash;&mdash;?</span>&rdquo; &ldquo;Mademoiselle
&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; was answered by another, and the crowd took up
the names, expressing their approbation or otherwise.</p>
<p>In the course of the next week the Valentin was to send to his
Valentine a bouquet, or other present; if she accepted it, she
appeared, with the cadeau, at the toilette of the Duchess, on the
following Sunday; if no present had been sent by the Valentin, his
neighbours lit a fire of straw in front of his house, as a sign of
their displeasure.</p>
<p>The ladies were to give a ball to their Valentins, and if they did
not do so, a straw-fire was lit before their houses.</p>
<p>These fires were called &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Br&ucirc;ler le
Valentin</span>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Valentine,&rdquo; and showed
&ldquo;the new-married&rdquo; had made <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>a mistake in their choice
for the unmarried. The chronicle finishes by saying, &ldquo;the people
were so pleased at seeing Stanislas and his queen taking a part in
their f&ecirc;te, that they did <i>not</i> pelt peas under their feet
when dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy is not a town of very ancient date like its neighbours, Metz
and Toul; it dates only from the eleventh century, and even then it was
merely &ldquo;a castle with a few houses clustered round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Joan of Arc, born at Domremy, near Toul, was first presented by
the Sire de Baudricourt to Duke Charles II., who gave her a horse and
arms, and sent her to Chinon to the King, Charles VII. of France, to
whom Joan made use of the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Je vous promets de par Dieu, premier qu&rsquo;il soit un an, tous
les Anglais hors de royaume je mettrai, et vous certifie que la
puissance en moi est.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>After her barbarous murder the King ennobled all her family, males
and females, in perpetuity; and they retained this privilege into the
seventeenth century, when a parliamentary decree confined the honours
to the males.</p>
<p>Many in Lorraine believed that Joan was not really burnt: this
belief gave rise to several impostors, one of whom was so successful
that she deceived even Joan&rsquo;s brothers, and under her assumed
name married a certain Seigneur des Armoises: another was for some time
believed in, and f&ecirc;ted accordingly, but at last, being confronted
with the King, he posed her by asking what was <i>the secret</i>
between them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>In 1445 the Duke of Suffolk arrived at Nancy to demand the hand of
Marguerite, Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s beautiful daughter, for Henry VI. of
England; Ren&eacute; willingly consented to this honour, and Marguerite
went forth to pass her troubled life in camps and battles, until, after
the murder of her husband and son, she returned to Lorraine, and died
in 1482, near St. Mihiel. She was remarkable, says the historian, for
her virtues, her talents, her courage, her misfortunes, and her
beauty.</p>
<p>Charles the Bold besieged and took Nancy in 1475; contrary to his
usual custom, he was most affable to the citizens, wishing to make
Nancy the capital city of the new kingdom he proposed carving out for
himself from the adjoining states; but his quarrel with the Swiss
arrested the progress of these schemes, and in his absence Ren&eacute;
II. retook the city, the garrison capitulating: after the capitulation
the governor sent Ren&eacute; a <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i> of horseflesh,
and told him that for several days they had been reduced to such
nourishment.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards Charles re-appeared, and again besieged the
city; Ren&eacute; departed to procure assistance from the Swiss, the
garrison promising to hold out for two months; and in keeping this
promise it suffered great hardships,&mdash;the walls were in ruin, a
terrible disease appeared within the town, and no less than four
hundred men were frozen to death on Christmas night only.</p>
<p>At length Ren&eacute; and the Swiss arrived; then the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>celebrated battle was fought in which Charles was
slain. It is said that before the fight commenced he feared for the
result, as, in putting on his helmet, the crest fell to the ground.
Ren&eacute; re-entered his capital by torchlight the same night.</p>
<p>Under its Duke, Charles IV., Nancy suffered much from war, and
endured several sieges; at length it was finally incorporated in the
French Empire in 1766.</p>

</div>
<p class="first">It is a rich green valley where these waters meet,
where the Meurthe dies, and dying, gives her waters to increase those
of her friend.</p>
<p>Bountifully watering the valley&rsquo;s soil, our river flows
through the department named after her, Moselle, and forms a large
island, where the ancient Roman aqueduct formerly strode over.</p>
<p>Of this aqueduct sixteen arches and one column still remain on the
right bank, at the village named Jouy aux Arches; from the gardens
above, the river is seen glittering through the valley, which is framed
into pictures by the huge arches.</p>
<p>Of course a legend exists that the Devil built this aqueduct. He had
promised to do it, for some unknown consideration, before cock-crow;
the cock, however, crowed too soon, and the Devil, irritated with the
cock and himself, kicked down an unoffending arch: the uncompleted
aqueduct soon became ruinous. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another legend makes Azita (a daughter of Noah) the builder of these
arches; she, being a cautious lady, erected them in order that, if
another flood came, she might climb up and be safe.</p>
<p>This aqueduct, which was six leagues long, poured its waters into a
vast bason, where representations of naval engagements were given by
the Romans. It was already a ruin in the tenth century.</p>
<p>Jouy is about six miles from Metz, which is esteemed the strongest
city in France, and is garrisoned by twelve thousand men. As we
approach the town the beautiful cathedral is seen looming large above
the other buildings; it was commenced in the eleventh century, and not
completed until the sixteenth: it is elegant in its proportions and
beautiful in its detail; another older church is incorporated into it,
and its windows are filled with very beautiful stained glass.</p>
<p>Approaching the town, the river breaks into two branches, and
another stream comes in, all helping to fortify the old capital of the
Austrasians.</p>
<p>The history of Metz is one of the most interesting that can be
studied; its first appearance in history is as the capital of the
Mediomatrices, and early it became the see of a Christian Bishop.</p>
<p>In the fifth century, Attila with his Huns swept like a pestilence
over Europe, and Metz was sacked and burnt; to the Romans, Attila was
&ldquo;the Scourge of God,&rdquo; to his countrymen little less than a
god himself. At length he was defeated by the allied Germans and Romans
on the plains of Chalons, after losing two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>hundred
thousand men; but even then his power was unbroken, and in a few months
he was before Rome, which city he was induced to spare by the
intercession of the Pontiff, Leo, who, arrayed in priestly robes and
surrounded by his clergy chanting hymns, sought him in his camp. Soon
after he retreated northwards, and was murdered by his wife,
Criemhilda, who was of German origin: with him fell his vast empire,
and the Huns disappeared beyond the Black Sea. This extraordinary
century saw the rise and fall of three separate kings and tribes. First
came Alaric, king of the Visigoths, who overran the Roman Empire and
took Rome itself by storm, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 410; but soon
after, dying suddenly, his kingdom perished with him. His body, it is
said, was laid in the bed of an Italian river, from which the stream
had been diverted; an immense treasure was placed around him, and the
stream returning to its natural course, the labourers were murdered,
and thus the secret of his burial-place was hid for ever. After him
came Attila; and lastly, Odoacer, sprung from the Heruli, became the
King of Italy, dethroning Romulus Augustus, the last Roman Emperor: he
perished too, being murdered in 493 by orders of Theodoric the
Ostrogoth.</p>
<p>During all these wars, and midst the crash of falling empires, rose
slowly the sun of Christianity, and soon its penetrating beams
dispersed the night that had obscured earth since the Roman splendour
had passed away. Now a king was baptized, and anon a martyr died, both
events alike serving to spread the religion of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>peace;
and on the ruins of Paganism is now built up the Church of Christ, and
a new period of the world&rsquo;s history begins with the downfall of
the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The history of Metz at this early period is the history of the
Austrasian kingdom, of which it was the capital.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fifth century, a nation called the Franks
appeared upon the scene of history: this nation was a powerful
confederacy of German tribes, and came from the north-western parts of
Germany.</p>
<p>They took possession of the neighbouring lands as far as the
Moselle, and, the half of them settling on that river, were called the
Salii. Gaul soon after being abandoned by the Romans, the Salii became
an entirely independent nation, and about <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
420, being emulous of the fame of the great Gothic King (Alaric), they
for the first time elected a king over themselves, and composed the
celebrated Salique law. This king is handed down to us under the name
of Pharamond, but it is very doubtful whether such a person ever
existed; he was succeeded by Clodion, whose successor, Merowig, was the
founder of the Merovingian dynasty: his grandson, Clovis, was the real
founder of the kingdom of the Franks; he died &ldquo;leaving a kingdom
more extensive than that of modern France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He divided his territories into four parts, but his son Clotaire
reunited them. Clovis was baptized a Christian in <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 493; he was ever the champion of the Church against
the great Arian heresy, and has received, therefore, from the
Church&rsquo;s hands, a meed of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"
href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>praise, certainly unwarranted,
&ldquo;as he had on all occasions shown himself a heartless ruffian, a
greedy conqueror, and a bloodthirsty tyrant;&rdquo; his great power was
only attained by wading through a sea of blood, flowing not only from
enemies, but also from his nearest relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Clotaire, who is recorded as having been &ldquo;cruel and
licentious, even for a Merovingian,&rdquo; dying, the kingdom was again
divided by his sons into four parts, Sigebert receiving Austrasia, with
Metz for his capital.</p>
<p>He married the beautiful Brunhilda, daughter of Athanagildis, king
of the Visigoths; and his brother, Chilperic, married her sister: this
sister was murdered at the instigation of Fredegunda, to whom Chilperic
was shortly after married. Then began a series of murders and bloodshed
between the rivals Brunhilda and Fredegunda.</p>
<p>Never, says the historian, has one family amassed such a heritage of
crime as King Clovis and his descendants,&mdash;the cruelties and
murders of his sons were far exceeded by those of his grandsons, their
wives, and successors. The history of this period is a chaos of
murders, treachery, and license. The kings lived each with several
wives and concubines, murdering each other and committing every crime;
while the queens caused those who opposed their power to be
assassinated, poisoned even their own sons, and sowed dissensions on
all sides, leading as vile lives as their husbands. Thus the
Merovingian race fell under the weight of its own crimes, and, long
before its final <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>extinction in 752, it possessed but the shadow of
authority, the real power being in the hands of subjects, termed Mayors
of the Palace, who, from being mere house-stewards, rose to be leaders
of the armies and presidents of the councils of their effeminate
monarchs.</p>
<p>It is curious to find this debased family, through all their
misdeeds, crimes, and impotency, still regarded with affection and
veneration by the mass of their subjects; and although mere puppets in
the hands of the Mayors, the people must have been unaware of their
loss of dignity, and their eyes must have been systematically blinded
by a fictitious state being preserved round these nominal kings. The
following legend of Theolinda will exemplify this; the Sigebert
referred to is Sigebert III., son of Dagobert I., who was the last of
the family that exercised anything like independent authority.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THEOLINDA.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the banks of the Moselle, Theolinda was the fairest
shepherdess; happy in love and beauty, she sat by the river&rsquo;s
bank, Alcidor&rsquo;s arm around her. While sitting thus they were
surprised by the approach of Sigebert and his Queen, who were passing a
few days in a solitary castle which stood near the banks of the
Moselle, surrounded by groves.</p>
<p>The King asked Alcidor if he would wish to serve in the army as a
knight&rsquo;s squire; and the Queen offered Theolinda to place her
among her ladies, where she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>would be &ldquo;as a rose among wild
flowers.&rdquo; Both humbly declined, urging that love was sufficient
for them, but professed that they were ready to lay down their lives,
if needful, for their King: he smiled and left them, assuring them of
his protection and assistance, should they need it.</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>The hordes of the Vandals were threatening Austrasia, and Sigebert
stood on the defensive, feeling his weakness; his general took up a
strong position in the Vosges mountains, and there awaited the
enemy.</p>
<p>The news of these events reached the quiet valleys of the Moselle,
and Alcidor hastened to fulfil his promise to the King, and joined the
army that was gathering in the forest of Ardennes; being known as a
brave man, and perfectly acquainted with the intricacies of the forest,
he was appointed to command a body of bowmen.</p>
<p>A battle ensued, and Alcidor, with his war-cry of
&ldquo;Theolinda,&rdquo; drove all before him, but in the heat of the
battle a javelin struck his heart; the battle was lost, and Theolinda
heard the news from a grey-haired shepherd: she dropped senseless to
the ground, but recovering, hastened to the royal camp.</p>
<p>The King was sitting in his council-chamber, surrounded by his
courtiers, in the city of Metz, when a knight came in and said,
&ldquo;Gracious prince! while setting the watch a virgin approached me;
she was majestically handsome and mild. First I took her for a
divinity, but she addressed me in the following <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>words,&mdash;&rsquo;Permit me to speak to the
General before the King quits the council-chamber.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admit her,&rdquo; quoth the King.</p>
<p>And Theolinda entered, looking mildly and steadfastly around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor shepherdess!&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;thy faithful
lover hath fallen; his memory will ever be dear to us. What can I do
for thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, King,&rdquo; replied Theolinda, &ldquo;last night I saw
him in my dreams, and he told me that by the decree of Heaven I am
ordained to stop the career of the barbarian hordes. Wheresoever I cast
my looks there shall the dark-red banner fail; the lilies shall advance
carried by thy general, I preceding. Thus the white dove shall precede
the army and victoriously soar aloft like the royal eagle; and I am
come, my King, to lead thy warriors to victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King, without hesitation, exclaimed, &ldquo;I feel the power of
her words, and grant Theolinda&rsquo;s request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrayed in glittering armour, and a white plume on her head,
Theolinda preceded the King&rsquo;s army: the King, on a fleet horse,
flew from rank to rank encouraging, and victory crowned their efforts;
the routed Vandals fled; and peace and prosperity returned to the banks
of the Moselle.</p>
<p>Returning in triumph, the festive train proceeded to the Cathedral,
and all being assembled within the sacred edifice, the King asked,
&ldquo;Where is the heroic maid that saved the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the ranks of the guards opened, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>Theolinda appeared; her arms were bright as the
morning-star, her eyes were clear and serious, roses adorned her
floating hair. The King addressed her thus: &ldquo;Be a member of the
most noble order; Pharamond&rsquo;s sword knights thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The virgin humbly bent her knee, he touched her with his sword, and
knights and people shouted, &ldquo;Hail! all hail! blessed be the
saviour of her country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One only request she made, which was, that at her death her ashes
should be laid with those of the dead Alcidor; and then, heedless of
remonstrance, departed to live the life of a hermit in the wilderness;
and many suffering pilgrims wandered to her for consolation.</p>
<p>Many years in pious seclusion she lived; at length Alcidor again
appeared to her in a dream, and said, &ldquo;Thy time of probation is
ended; follow me now to the regions of eternal bliss!&rdquo; She
inclined her head and died. They laid her, as she had requested, with
Alcidor.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In many points of view this legend is curious and interesting;
perhaps, could we tear the veil from history, we might find that these
Merovingians were not so black as they are painted, or, at any rate,
that it was owing to some redeeming points that they lived thus in
their subjects&rsquo; hearts. Curious especially is this legend,
inasmuch as in all probability it may have incited Joan of Arc to
perform her deeds, the similarity of the two stories being remarkable;
and there can be but little doubt that this legend was rife at
Joan&rsquo;s day in this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>district, near which she lived: in
any case, the legend is touchingly simple and beautiful; it is given at
great length in &ldquo;Traditions of the Countries of the Rhine,&rdquo;
by Dr. Aloys Schreiber.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The Bishops of Metz early played an important part in history.
Arnulph, who flourished about 622, was almost a king in power, and from
him descended Charles Martel, whose son Pepin became in name, as his
father had long been in fact, King of France.</p>
<p>Pepin&rsquo;s son Charlemagne, we are told, held his court at
Thionville (about twenty miles lower down the Moselle). Here he was
accompanied by his seven beautiful daughters; all taught to work in
wool, to ride, and to hunt, in order that they might not be corrupted
by idleness: they all supped with him, and when he journeyed rode after
him on horseback.</p>
<p>Charlemagne was said to have been seven feet high, and his arm was
as mighty as his genius; wisdom and dignity sat on his brow; his seal
was the handle of his sword, and he was wont to say, &ldquo;With my
sword I maintain all to which I affix my seal.&rdquo; He died in 814,
and was buried sitting upright as on a throne, and clothed in his
imperial robes.</p>
<p>His successor, Louis, convoked the States at Thionville in 835; no
less than eight Archbishops and thirty-five Bishops attended on this
occasion, so numerous had become the Christian prelates. In 869 Charles
the Bald was crowned at Metz, the Bishops of Metz and Toul being
especially mentioned; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span>and in his grandson&rsquo;s reign we find a
Bishop Wala, of Metz, killed before the gates of that city, while
fighting bravely in its defence against the Norsemen, who at this
period made frequent incursions into France and the adjoining
countries. Bishops had ceased to be pastors, and become warriors and
temporal princes.</p>
<p>The Bishops of Metz were long able to maintain their authority in
the city, though often the citizens disputed it. In Henry the
Fowler&rsquo;s reign, Metz became a free imperial city; and in the
twelfth century a Ma&icirc;tre Echevin, with twelve councillors, was
established, and for centuries this form of government was adhered to:
thus the Bishops were superseded by a Republic. They still, however,
enjoyed considerable power, being the principal parties in the election
of the Ma&icirc;tre and his council.</p>
<p>A curious legend of Metz is handed down to us from the beginning of
the thirteenth century.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE MIRACULOUS SHIRT.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Metz there lived a lady named Florentina, whose
husband, Alexander, was going to the Crusades; she presented him, on
his departure, with a miraculous shirt, which would always retain its
purity (a great comfort in a crusade).</p>
<p>The Knight was taken prisoner, and being put to labour, the Sultan
remarked the extraordinary circumstance of a prisoner being always in a
clean shirt, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>inquired the reason. Alexander told him it was a
miraculous shirt, which would always remain as spotless as his
wife&rsquo;s virtue.</p>
<p>The Sultan despatched a cunning man to undermine the lady&rsquo;s
virtue, as he thought ill of the sex.</p>
<p>The emissary was quite unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Florentina having learnt from the cunning man her husband&rsquo;s
condition, disguised herself as a pilgrim, and reached the place of his
captivity. She then, by her singing, so charmed the Sultan, that, at
her request, he made her a present of a slave who she selected. This
was her husband; and she gave him his liberty, and received in exchange
from him a piece of the miraculous shirt, he not recognising his
wife.</p>
<p>Florentina hastened back to Metz, but Alexander arrived there first,
and was informed by his friends of his wife&rsquo;s long absence during
his captivity. When she arrived, he bitterly reproached her (although
the shirt had not become dirty). She explained, and produced the piece
he had given her, thus showing how she had been employed; and so they
lived happily together.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Very quaint is this legend, and we are at a loss to understand the
origin of so curious an invention. The following is a story of the same
date, and, though not belonging to Metz, serves to illustrate this
period:&mdash;</p>
<p>A Thuringian Count, who was married, being taken prisoner in the
East, the Sultan&rsquo;s daughter fell in love <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>with
him, gave him his liberty, and fled with him to Europe, he promising to
marry her.</p>
<p>On arriving at home he presented her to his Countess, and with the
consent of all parties, and the Pope&rsquo;s sanction, wedded her also,
and they all three lived very happily together. At Erfurt may be seen
the three effigies, the Count in the centre: the tombs have been
opened, and one of the skulls was found to be like an Asiatic&rsquo;s,
thus in some measure corroborating the truth of this remarkable
tale.</p>

</div>
<p>We have now emerged from what may be termed the ancient history of
Metz, and the more detailed accounts of the modern period give us a
series of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>sieges, battles, and plots, from which we will
select those appearing the most interesting.</p>
<p>In 1354 the Emperor Charles IV. remained some time at Metz, and
returned there again two years after, when he held a Diet, at which the
Archbishops of Tr&egrave;ves, Cologne, and Mayence, and the four
lay-Electors, were present. At this Diet additions were made to the
celebrated Golden Bull, which was then published, and remained the law
of the Empire until the nineteenth century. Metz was now at the height
of its glory. Now, say the &ldquo;Annals,&rdquo; Metz was resplendent
with knights, princes, dukes, and archbishops. The Emperor, clothed
with the imperial ensigns, and surrounded by the great officers of
state, the naked sword in his hand and the crown on his head, attended
service in the Cathedral.</p>
<p>A party in the town wished to raise a tumult, and deliver the city
to the Emperor; but the Cardinal de Piergort representing the infamy of
such treachery, the Emperor sent for the chiefs of the city and gave up
to them the traitors, who, when night-time came, were drowned in the
river. The Emperor departed, and then followed a series of discords
unimportant except to the actors.</p>
<p>In 1365, companies of countrymen, and pillagers set free by the
peace of Bretigny, succeeded each other in attacking Metz, and ravaging
the neighbourhood. With some difficulty they were defeated and
dispersed.</p>
<p>No sooner were these petty wars ended, than a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>larger
one broke out with the Lorrainese; and the Count de Bar advanced to
Metz and defied the Messins to combat, sending them a bloody gauntlet.
The citizens, however, declined the conflict, and peace was
concluded.</p>
<p>In 1405 an <i lang="fr">&eacute;meute</i> took place in the town,
and the people rising turned out the magistrates, and replaced them
with their own representatives. Soon, however, the ancient rulers
managed to reinstate themselves, and took a bloody vengeance on their
enemies.</p>
<p>In 1407, the Duke de Bar resolved to take Metz by surprise. He
secretly fitted out a train of boats, filled with arms and munitions of
war, and sent a large body of soldiers, who secreted themselves near
the town. All was prepared, and on the morrow an attack was to be made,
when a sudden panic seized the attacking party, and they fled, leaving
their boats and munitions, by which the Messins learnt the peril they
had escaped.</p>
<p>In 1444, a furious war was waged between the Duke of Lorraine and
the Messins: the Duke was assisted by his brother-in-law, Charles VII.
of France. The quarrel originated in some money claims that the city
had on the Duchess of Lorraine, which claims she refused to satisfy.
The irritated Messins seized on the lady&rsquo;s baggage between
Pont-&agrave;-Mousson and Nancy, as she was performing a pilgrimage to
the former. The Duke, in revenge, besieged the city, and the burghers
ravaged his territories. Much blood was shed on both sides, until at
last peace was made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55"
name="pb55">55</a>]</span>between the belligerents by the King, who
received a sum of money from the Messins. So powerful was this
republic, that it could single-handed wage war with a sovereign
prince.</p>
<p>A few years after, when the celebrated War of Investitures took
place, the Messins were called on to fight for Adolphe of Nassau, the
nominee of the Pope. They pleaded their privileges and the late ruinous
wars, and begged to remain neutral. The Pope, in consequence,
excommunicated the city; a great number of the clergy obeyed the Papal
Bull, and left in procession for Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, with the cross
and banners at their head. For three years this extraordinary state of
things lasted, during which time the churches were empty and the dying
unshriven. At length the Pope took off the interdict, and the priests
and canons returned, but the Messins had to pay dearly for their
opposition to ecclesiastical power.</p>
<p>About this period the wily Louis XI. of France thought the time was
come for joining Metz to his dominions; he accordingly wrote a kind,
mild letter to the citizens, suggesting that they should put themselves
under his protection, and thus secure their peace. The citizens wrote
back cautiously, but expressed their surprise at the King&rsquo;s
proposition; he, fearing to incense and thus throw so powerful a city
into alliance with the noblesse that were taking part against him,
disowned his herald, and denied the letter he had sent.</p>
<p>The next event was an endeavour to take Metz by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>storm,
on the part of the Duke of Lorraine, and it very nearly succeeded.
Early in the morning of the 9th April, 1473, while the Messins still
slept, ten thousand Lorrainese arrived near the walls from
Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, having marched during the night; with them was a
certain Krantz, nicknamed &ldquo;La Grande Barbe,&rdquo; who had
constructed a peculiar waggon, filled with casks, which was capable of
sustaining the weight of a portcullis, and thus preventing its closing
when once it had been raised.</p>
<p>Disguised as merchants, Krantz and some of his companions, with a
train of waggons filled with casks, among which was the
peculiarly-constructed one, appeared before the city gates, and were
admitted; the waggons entered, and the particular one was halted
immediately beneath the portcullis, the pretended merchants then rushed
on the guardian of the gate and killed him.</p>
<p>Being joined by a select body of five hundred men, who quickly
entered, La Grande Barbe raised the shout of &ldquo;Ville
gagn&eacute;e!&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;Slay, slay, women and children;
spare none! Vive Lorraine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The awakened burghers rushed in disorder from their beds, knowing
what these sounds portended, and all was lost but for the presence of
mind of a baker named Harelle, who lived near the gate under which the
waggon was stationed. He ran to the house over the gate, and succeeded
in lowering the side portions of the portcullis, so that horsemen could
not enter, and foot soldiers only by creeping under the waggon.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then rushing into the streets, Harelle rallied and encouraged the
citizens, and finally routed the Lorrainese, slaying La Grande Barbe
and two hundred of his companions, the rest escaping by flight.</p>
<p>In a few minutes all was over; the assaulters dead or flown, the
gates reclosed, and the assembled Council preparing to prosecute the
war. Thus the clear-headed baker saved the good city of Metz.</p>
<p>In 1473 the Emperor Frederick III. visited the town, and the keys
being presented to him, he promised solemnly to preserve the liberties
of the citizens. He then, accompanied by his son, Maximilian, entered
in state, followed by the Archbishop of Mayence, and other princes and
prelates.</p>
<p>The Messins had been so harassed by attempts at surprise that they
now were ever on their guard against them; and so fearful had they
become, that when the Emperor, in visiting their church, came to the
great bell, and expressed a wish to hear it sound, they declined
respectfully, saying it was an old custom only to sound it thrice in
the year. This they did, fearing it might be meant as a signal of
attack on their hardly-maintained liberties. They also had, during the
Emperor&rsquo;s visit, 2000 men constantly under arms, ready to obey
the Ma&icirc;tre Echevin&rsquo;s orders at a moment&rsquo;s notice; and
they kept strict guard over the gates.</p>
<p>While Frederick was with them the Messins refused to admit Charles
the Bold, with more than five hundred horsemen. He was furious, but the
Emperor agreed to meet him at Tr&egrave;ves instead; and afterwards
Duke <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>Charles had no time or opportunity to revenge
himself on Metz, but rather conciliated that powerful city, and when he
took Nancy sent a present of cannon and other spoil to the Messins, who
were delighted at the misfortune of their old enemies, the
Lorrainese.</p>
<p>In 1491 another attempt was made by the Duke of Lorraine to gain
possession of the town. Surprise and stratagem having previously
failed, he now tried treachery, and secured the services of a certain
Sire Jehan de Landremont, who induced one of the gatekeepers, named
Charles Cauvellet, a Breton by birth, but who had acquired the rights
of citizenship, to join the plot.</p>
<p>All was easily arranged, thanks to Cauvellet, who had the keys of
the city. A day was fixed on, but it turning out so rainy that the
river flooded the approaches to the town, a fresh day was named; in the
meantime Cauvellet&rsquo;s conscience pricked him, and he confessed the
plot to the Ma&icirc;tre Echevin. His life was spared, but the Sire de
Landremont, after his sentence had been read at every cross-street in
the town, he being led about on horseback for this purpose, was
strangled, drawn, and quartered. He died with a smile on his
countenance, saying he only regretted having been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>A peace was soon after patched up between Ren&eacute; and the
Messins.</p>
<p>Though so long resisting, the city was doomed eventually to fall by
treachery, and the time at length arrived. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>In 1552, Henry II. of France entered Lorraine, and occupied
Pont-&agrave;-Mousson. On the 10th of April he presented himself before
the gates of Metz, which is styled in the annals of the day &ldquo;a
great and rich imperial city, very jealous of its liberties.&rdquo;
Although Henry had taken the most rigorous measures to suppress
Protestantism in his own dominions, he here appeared as the champion of
that religion, and entered into a secret treaty with the Protestant
Princes, who agreed that he should occupy Metz, Courtrai, Toul, and
Verdun, as Vicar-Imperial. Henry, wishing to gain immediate possession
of Metz, engaged his ally, the Bishop, to bribe the inhabitants of the
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Quartier du Heu</span>,&rdquo; and raise
dissensions among the garrison. These preparations made, the Sieur de
Tavannes arrived before that quartier, and harangued the people,
telling them that the good King Henry was fighting for their liberties,
and they could not do less than allow him to lodge in their town with
his body-guard of five hundred men. &ldquo;Surely that was not too much
to grant to their defender?&rdquo; The people, half-persuaded, allowed
a body of men to approach and commence filing through the gate, but
seeing that instead of five hundred there were nearly five thousand
drawing near, they wished to close the gate; but Tavannes continued to
speak them fair until upwards of seven hundred picked men had entered,
when a Swiss captain, who held the keys for Metz, seeing the number,
threw the keys at Tavannes&rsquo; head, exclaiming in the idiom of the
country, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Tout est chou&eacute;</span>.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus was Metz taken, kings and nobles thinking any treachery fair
against mere bourgeois. Of course Henry kept it for himself, not the
Protestant interest; and henceforward it remained a portion of the
French dominions.</p>
<p>Before the Emperor Charles V. allowed so important a free city
quietly to revert to France, he sent Alba with a large army to besiege
it, he remaining at Thionville to watch proceedings, his health being
too bad to allow him to prosecute the siege in person.</p>
<p>The town was defended by the young Duke of Guise, who turned out all
the women, old men, and children, and pulled down half the town in
order the better to defend the other half; working himself in the
trenches, he by his example so encouraged his soldiers and citizens,
that they sustained all the assaults of the Imperialists.</p>
<p>Charles V., seeing that the siege did not progress, and that the
breaches were repaired as fast as made; finding also that his own army
was rapidly wasting with cold and sickness, reluctantly ordered Alba to
raise the siege; the Duke retired, leaving his tents and sick, together
with a great quantity of baggage and munitions: to the credit of the
conquerors, they treated the sick with great kindness, contrary to the
usual custom at that period. Charles departed, saying that he perceived
&ldquo;Fortune, like other women, accorded her favours to the young,
and disdained grey locks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1555, the people of Metz became exceedingly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>discontented at the Governor&rsquo;s taking-away
many of their ancient liberties; this gave rise to the</p>

<h3 class="main">PLOT OF THE CORDELIERS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Cordelier, named le P&egrave;re L&eacute;onard,
guardian of a convent, engaged many of the leading townspeople in a
conspiracy to retake Metz from the French.</p>
<p>For this purpose, having first persuaded his brother monks to join
him, he introduced into the convent, which had walls capable of
defence, arms and soldiers.</p>
<p>He then agreed with the Governor of Thionville to open an entrance
into the town for a body of Imperialist troops on a given night; at the
same time, to distract the French, the town was to be fired in several
places.</p>
<p>Vieilleville, the Governor of Metz, hearing that a Cordelier was
constantly seen in conversation with the Governor of Thionville, became
suspicious, and suddenly visiting the convent, found the arms and
concealed men; he also seized P&egrave;re L&eacute;onard as he entered
the city on his return from Thionville, and learning from him that a
body of Imperial troops was to march to Metz that very night,
despatched a force, which, taking them by surprise, routed them and cut
them to pieces.</p>
<p>The monks, from whom by promises and threats he had extorted a full
disclosure of the plot, he threw into a dungeon, telling them they
should be hanged next day, and might confess to each other.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the dungeon being opened in the morning, it was found that the
monks, enraged with the Superior, who had drawn them into the plot, had
killed him and maimed his four advisers; these latter were, with ten of
their brethren, hanged, and the ten youngest were exiled from the
town.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In 1631, Metz capitulated to Gustavus Adolphus; he remained there
all the winter, and presented the Bishop&rsquo;s library to his
Chancellor, Oxenstiern, who sent it off to Sweden; but the vessel sank
and the books were lost.</p>
<p>The only other extract from the history of Metz we shall here give
is of a different character.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Louis XV. arrived at Metz with a strong army, in order to oppose
Charles of Lorraine, whose duchy he had given to Stanislas of
Poland.</p>
<p>Louis, who was accompanied by his mistress, the Duchess of
Ch&acirc;teauroux, and her sister, was taken mortally ill; previously
there had been erected a wooden gallery, which led, along the sides of
four streets, from the Duchess&rsquo;s apartments to those of the King:
this gallery was now given up at the angry remonstrances of the people,
who were much scandalized by the proceedings, and the sisters proceeded
to the King&rsquo;s residence, where they shut themselves into an
apartment adjoining that of the dying monarch.</p>
<p>The Duke de Richelieu, who was in league with the Duchess, was First
Lord of the Bedchamber, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href=
"#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>would not allow any of the Princes to
have access to the King.</p>
<p>The town urged the King&rsquo;s Confessor to remonstrate with him,
but he refused; then the Bishop of Soissons undertook the task, and
threatened the King that he would not administer the last sacrament to
him if he refused to dismiss his mistresses. The doors were thrown open
between the King&rsquo;s room and that where the Duchesses sat,
anxiously waiting the turn of events.</p>
<p>At length the King was induced to order them to depart, and they
fled into the country.</p>
<p>Contrary to all expectation, and in consequence of a strong dose
administered by a quack, the King recovered, after he had been given
over by his doctors and received the last sacrament. The Duchesses were
recalled.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Metz at the present day is the chief town of the Department of the
Moselle; it is situated on both banks and the island formed by the
embranchment of the river: its picturesque streets are connected by
several bridges, from which the views are very striking.</p>
<p>It has excellent bathing establishments, fine caf&eacute;s, a
theatre, good shops, and above all a promenade, almost unequalled in
beauty; it is situated on very high ground, densely shaded with great
trees: seats, and flowers, and grass are there; the military bands play
in the evening; the ladies are handsome and well-dressed, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>and from
the walks the view extends for many miles over the green plains of the
Moselle; the different branches of the river shine in the valley; the
sun sets over the hills which westward bound the view, its golden light
streams through the foliage and suffuses the whole valley; little boats
glide up and down the stream; merry voices sing in the distance; and
thus, with music, beauty, and sunshine, we leave the old Austrasian
capital.</p>

<p>Leaving Metz, and all its soldiers, ramparts, and ditches far
behind, our river, passing through a level country, arrives at
Thionville. This town was in the diocese of Tr&egrave;ves, and
dependent on the Parliament of Metz. Here Charlemagne had a favourite
palace; and here, in a solemn assembly, he parted his vast estates
between his three sons.</p>
<p>Its history is like that of Metz, made up of sieges, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>assaults, and surprises, but of less importance
and less interest. It was always a strong place, and at the present day
its fortifications, constructed by Vauban and Cormontaigne, are amongst
the strongest in Europe: it lies in a level plain, and is
uninteresting, though rather picturesque.</p>
<p>The Moselle rolls on, and in about twelve miles reaches Sierck, a
clean little town, on its right bank; and then we pass from France to
Prussia, and our river becomes German, its future beauty beginning to
dawn as it approaches Tr&egrave;ves. Two streams here increase the
volume of her waters&mdash;a smaller one on the left, and the Saar on
the right.</p>
<p>There is one peculiar charm about the banks and neighbourhood of the
Moselle, found equally at its source near Bussang, and amidst the
German hills, this is, the number and variety of the beautiful
wild-flowers with which its whole course teems, and with which our
river is, as it were, garlanded.</p>

<p class="line">Blackberries, with fruit and thorn,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1037">With the wild hop intertwine;</p>

<p class="line xd21e1037">And their loveliness combine.</p>

<p class="line">As she roams from place to place,</p>
<p class="line">Scattering beauty o&rsquo;er the ground;</p>
<p class="line">Thus the earth with flowers is crowned.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Only a few of the flowers that we find growing there
are enumerated in the above; moreover, they are more beautiful than
wild flowers usually are, attaining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"
href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>to great size; the enothera,
harebells, and campanulas, with wild geraniums, and a host of others,
go to swell the list.</p>
<p>Before the Saar runs in, the red rocks of Tr&egrave;ves appear on
the left bank, jutting over the trees, close to the river&rsquo;s
course; then they retire inland, until the old Roman bridge is reached;
there they again approach, and from their heights the remnant of old
Tr&egrave;ves is spread out, environed by its avenues and studded with
its churches and ruins. The river is beneath; and the eight-arched
bridge, complete as in the golden days of Rome, clasps the waist of our
river as a zone encircling that of a young girl just budding into
womanhood.</p>
<p>And so, our graceful woman-stream at Tr&egrave;ves ceases her
girlhood and becomes more beautiful, more reflective, and more
graceful; the hills draw near, and the vineyards sparkle among the
rocks; her handmaidens, the brooks, wait at every turn to tend her,
increasing her beauty; and following in her train, pass along in
glorious procession, the trees bending and the rocks falling back
before the might of innocence and love.</p>
<p>Strong in innocence, with virgin bosom unsullied, nothing less
bright than heaven&rsquo;s reflection ever having rested there; but
mightier still in love,&mdash;abounding love,&mdash;that causes her to
feed the earth and fertilise the soil wherever she passes; so that man,
receiving at her hands his daily food, thanks and blesses her, and
praises, through her, her Creator.</p>
<p>We, the lookers-on, or lighter toilers, should bless her surely not
less than the poor vine-dresser or digger <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>of the soil. True, for
one she has carved the rock into sunny platforms, and for the other she
has left upon the rocks a thick coating of productive earths; but to us
she has given that brighter gift of higher value far,&mdash;the impress
of God&rsquo;s beneficence, not merely through material food and drink,
but through the superior senses which feed the mind.</p>
<p>It is impossible to wander from the source of our Moselle, to muse
over the rise and fall of the nations and cities on her banks, to look
upon her rocks and flowers, to glide adown her stream, to stand amidst
the ruined walls of her old towers, to watch the seed-time and harvest
on her banks, the clustering bunches and the brilliant glow of the wine
and corn, with all the lesser incidents adorning her;&mdash;it is
impossible to view all these, to ruminate and gaze, to live with her
and be of her in all her windings, all her sunshine and refreshing
shade, and not imbibe a portion of her spirit; a portion, larger as we
look deeper and think more, of her innocence and peace of mind, which,
laid up within our hearts, as the corn and wine within the store, will
give us at a future time joy and gladness.</p>
<p>Harvest-time passes, and the vintage ends; but when the long winter
comes, their productiveness is present, and the stores laid up are
found to be indeed true treasures. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70"

<p>&ldquo;Augusta Trevirorum&rdquo; of the Romans, &ldquo;Trier&rdquo;
of the Germans, and &ldquo;Tr&egrave;ves&rdquo; to English, is, or at
any rate claims to be, the most ancient city of Europe; according to
the legend it was founded by a Prince Trebeta, who was driven out of
his Asiatic possessions by Semiramis. He is described as having been a
wise and strong prince, who built a magnificent palace of vast strength
on the heights over the Moselle, opposite to the town, which he called
after his own name: these things he did 1300 years before the
foundation of Rome; and on the &ldquo;Rothen Haus&rdquo; in
Tr&egrave;ves are still the words, &ldquo;<i lang="la">Ante Romam
Treviris stetit annis mille trecentis.</i>&rdquo; A picture, said to
represent this Prince Trebeta, is in the Town-hall: he is sitting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>on his father&rsquo;s lap, with the spires of the
Cathedral in his hand.</p>
<p>Very interesting is Tr&egrave;ves; and if we cannot place confidence
in Prince Trebeta and his days, we must turn to that surer period when
it was the capital of the Roman dominions beyond the Alps, and received
the name of Augusta of the Trevii; these Trevii being the German tribe
residing around this part of the Moselle.</p>
<p>Under its Roman name Tr&egrave;ves rose to the height of its glory;
it was then celebrated for the number of its magnificent temples, its
splendid palaces, its amphitheatre and baths. Remnants of this past
splendour still exist; such as portions of the baths and amphitheatre,
the bridge, and especially the Porta Nigra, which is one of the finest
Roman ruins extant.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Porta Nigra.</p>
</div>
<p>Tr&egrave;ves was frequently the residence of the Roman Emperors,
and its inhabitants had all the privileges of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>Roman
citizenship. In the last half of the third century Galienus held his
court here; and here Maximian was attacked by the Franks, whom he
defeated. Here Constantine the Great, when celebrating a victory that
he had gained over the Franks, caused two of the captive princes to be
thrown to wild beasts in the arena. They met their death with smiles,
and shortly after the whole of the German nation rose to avenge them.
Constantine disguised himself, and entering the hostile camp, gave the
enemy false information, which led to their total defeat, <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 310. The simple-minded Germans were no match for the
Romans in fraud; they deemed any ambuscade, or advantage taken against
an enemy, dishonourable, and we even find them sending messages to
their opponents of the day and hour upon which they intended to attack
them.</p>
<p>The cruelty of throwing captives to wild beasts, however, we find
surpassed by a German named Magnentius, who, having become a Roman
soldier, set himself up for Emperor in opposition to Constantius. This
Magnentius, on the eve of the great battle of Marsa, sacrificed a
maiden, and mixing her blood with wine, gave his army to drink, and
invoked his gods, pouring a libation of this fiendish drink in their
honour. He was totally defeated, and killed himself.</p>
<p>The Western Empire of the Romans fell, and Germans walked the
streets of Rome, supplanting with their fresh vigour the worn-out
strength of that wonderful empire, on the ruins of which their leaders
planted their feet, which at first slipped and stumbled, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>eventually found a firm basis, on which was
erected what we call Modern History.</p>

<h3 class="main">LEGEND OF THE GREAT CANAL FROM TR&Egrave;VES TO
COLOGNE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For more than a hundred years the people of Cologne
had been endeavouring to raise a Cathedral that should eclipse all
others. The master-builder was busy making measurements for the arch of
the great door, when one of his apprentices jeeringly said the building
would never be finished, but ever remain in fragments. Thereupon the
master waxed wroth and dismissed the apprentice, who departed, saying:
&ldquo;Woe to thee, O my master! never shall thy work be finished;
sooner shall I complete a canal from here to Trier, than shalt thou
place a tower upon thy cathedral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years passed on, and the Cathedral was rapidly approaching to
completion, when the master saw a huge worm creep from the ground. This
was the fiend, by whose assistance the apprentice had made a canal from
Tr&egrave;ves to Cologne: the apprentice appeared to the astonished
master and said, &ldquo;Lo, my canal is complete, while thy church is
yet a fragment!&rdquo; and water flowed from the canal, on which a duck
came swimming from Tr&egrave;ves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>The water rose and encompassed the master, who thus perished, and
his cathedral is still unfinished; but the wicked apprentice fared
still worse, for the great worm strangled him, and he is doomed
evermore to haunt the cathedral, measuring the uncompleted works.</p>
<p>The canal thus formed was used to send wine from Tr&egrave;ves to
Cologne, without the trouble of putting it into casks.<a class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While meditating over his undertaking, the contractor
for the building of the Dom was accosted by a gentlemanlike stranger in
red, who said to him in a hearty tone, &ldquo;Cheer up, for I can help
you; but first tell me for what purpose you wish so large a
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contractor, delighted, guessed who the stranger was, and replied
in artful words that he wished to raise this house for a gambling and
drinking palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; said the man in red, &ldquo;just what I am
fond of!&rdquo; and they agreed upon terms and went to work.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p>The building went bravely on, until the Red Man seeing altars and
such-like things arising, with which he was then unacquainted, asked
what it all meant; but being told that these were tables for dice, was
satisfied.</p>
<p>One day, returning from the roof to which he had been carrying up
large stones, the Red Man saw the Bishop consecrating the new church;
then the bells tolled solemnly, and Satan found he had been outwitted.
He rushed at an altar, and endeavoured to tear it down, but left a claw
sticking into it, it having been consecrated; then with a yell he fled,
and the contractor mocked him, shouting &ldquo;Never build more
churches without a written agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversion of the heathen Trevii to Christianity was, according
to the legend, thus effected:&mdash;</p>
<p>The people of Tr&egrave;ves worshipped a statue of marble, from
whose mouth oracles proceeded; troops of pilgrims came to Tr&egrave;ves
to hear from this idol&rsquo;s lips answers to their questions: but now
a foreign priest appeared before the crowd, and with a crucifix in his
hand he spoke to them of Christ the Son of God; the people, leaving
their idol for the Truth, flocked to his feet, in spite of the threats
of the heathen priests.</p>
<p>Thus Saint Eucharius converted the Trevii.</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>The Moselle country was especially resorted to by hermits, who lived
in recesses of the mountains; of these Saint Antony was the first.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>Saint Nicolas was the patron of the bridge, and his statue stands
beneath the stone crucifix which adorns it. On one occasion, a mariner,
whose ship was in great danger of being cast away beneath the bridge,
called on the Saint, and vowed an offering of a taper as big as his
mast should he escape.</p>
<p>He landed in safety, but finding himself secure snapped his fingers
at the Saint, saying, &ldquo;Nicolas, thou wilt not have so
much.&rdquo; The Saint replied not.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE RING.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A certain man of noble family, after leading a
glorious life, committed fratricide; repenting of his crime he left his
country, and after many years arrived at Tr&egrave;ves.</p>
<p>At sunset he stood upon the Moselle bridge, and there, kneeling
before the crucifix, wept; his tears flowing into the stream beneath:
an Angel swept by, and left him a palm-twig from heaven. He exultingly
cried, &ldquo;Lord, forgive my sins before my end&mdash;never will I
cease to repent my grievous sin;&rdquo; then, throwing his ring, which
he had taken from his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"
name="pb77">77</a>]</span>brother, into the river, he prayed that if he
were forgiven it should be returned to him.</p>
<p>Rising, he retired into a monastery, and eventually became a Bishop.
A fisherman one day arrived and offered him a fish; he took it,
thinking it a mark of reverence.</p>
<p>At dinner the cook approached and presented him with a ring, which
he had found within the fish.</p>
<p>The Bishop perceived it was his own, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Heaven
has sent it to me as a proof of forgiveness!&rdquo; expired.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE CRUCIFIX IN THE MARKET-PLACE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the market-place at Tr&egrave;ves there stands a
column, with a crucifix on its summit. An inscription on it gives the
following miracle as the cause of its erection.</p>
<p>The Huns were swarming over Germany, burning and destroying all
things: their march was as a pestilence; but the people of
Tr&egrave;ves were gay and merry, as if no danger
threatened,&mdash;they rioted in wine, and luxury.</p>
<p>One man only, within the city, still remained sober and prudent, and
he dreamt that he saw a great monster descending from the Marcusberg
and crawling its hideous length towards Tr&egrave;ves; arriving at the
Moselle, the loathsome monster rolled into its blue waves, and caused
them so to swell that the city was overflowed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>Awaking, this good man ran to the Archbishop and told his dream,
explaining its meaning to be that the Huns were marching on the city by
the Marcusberg; the Archbishop only laughed at him, at which he grew
angry: but soon better thoughts possessed him, and he prayed Heaven to
avert the impending ruin.</p>
<p>The sky grew black and dreadful; a nameless horror came upon the
people, and falling down they implored pardon for their sins, and
crosses fell from heaven.</p>
<p>Then, believing, they marched out to the Marcusberg, and finding the
Huns vanquished them.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Two new powers arose in Europe during the last days of the Roman
Empire: the one, as we have before said, planted its feet on the ruins
of Imperial Rome, and henceforth wielded her temporal
authority,&mdash;this was the German, or Frankish power; the other,
amidst the fallen temples overthrown by the German conquerors, raised
up a fairer temple and a purer worship,&mdash;this was the Church of
Christ. At first over-shadowed by the more gorgeous worship and grander
temples of the false gods of Paganism, the new Church had to struggle
for a mere existence; but these being overthrown, the remnants of
Paganism soon melted away before the innate majesty of truth, and the
fanes of superstition crumbling into dust, afforded a sure foundation
for the new and mightier edifice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"
href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>These two powers, at the extinction of the Western Empire, ruled
nearly the whole of Europe: neither was as yet concentrated, both had
many heads, and it was not until the two powers coalesced that either
attained that temporal influence which they have since possessed. Hand
in hand, we find these two powers progressing in might and influence;
sometimes a temporary quarrel would separate, but common interest
invariably reunited them.</p>
<p>It is in its infancy that the Church of Christ shines with its
purest light; and it is, consequently, to this period that the mind
loves to revert, and dwell on &ldquo;that happy spring time&rdquo; when
the Fathers of the Church went forth among the heathen, gathering the
nations into one family, the centre and head of which was God. How
wonderful to watch &ldquo;the little star appearing in the East,&rdquo;
and rising over the ruins and decaying temples of old Rome, till
gradually the whole air was filled with the &ldquo;light of
truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas! that a time should come when, waning from its throne on high,
the Church fell so low in the person of its ministers and adherents,
that we find the chroniclers of the fifteenth century recording that
&ldquo;Nuns did what the Devil was ashamed to think; and that Abbots,
by means of their <i>poverty</i>, became the greatest proprietors; of
their <i>obedience</i>, mighty princes; and of their <i>chastity</i>,
husbands of all women;&rdquo; and we hear of men complaining that they
were not rich enough to become monks.</p>
<p>It is needless, however, here to give an account of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>those
vicious customs that arose within the bosom of the Church of Rome, and
eventually caused what we have quoted; we will rather turn to the
legends of the earlier period, many of which are singularly beautiful.
Among them we shall find many things which at first sight may provoke a
smile, but on reflection we shall arrive at the meaning of what must be
taken merely as an allegory.</p>
<p>For instance, we are told that &ldquo;King Sigebert appointed St.
Goar to the Bishopric of Tr&egrave;ves, and the Saint entering the
King&rsquo;s saloon, hung his cloak over a sunbeam, to prove that he
was enlightened by God.&rdquo; This would probably be an illustration
of the power of faith, and so with the other legends of the time. Here
we shall only select a few that are immediately connected with
Tr&egrave;ves.</p>

href="#xd21e2137" name="xd21e2137src">3</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The great King Eigel resided at Tr&egrave;ves. He was
supreme over twelve kingdoms; his favourite son was Orendel.</p>
<p>Orendel having reached his thirteenth birth-day was invested with a
sword, and vowed before the Virgin to be &ldquo;a true chevalier on
earth, and a defender of widows and orphans;&rdquo; then proceeding to
his father, he begged of him a wife, that the kingdom might have a
queen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>His father told him there was none in all his kingdoms worthy to be
his spouse; but at Jerusalem there lived a beautiful Queen, Breide by
name, to whom the holy grave belonged: her he must seek, and could he
succeed in wedding her, his happiness would be complete.</p>
<p>Orendel, transported with the account of this virgin queen, prayed
his father to prepare him ships. His father consented, and three years
were spent in preparing for the expedition.</p>
<p>Then in a great assembly the young King, who wished none but
volunteers to go with him on his journey, spake aloud: &ldquo;Where are
ye, O courageous Kings! who will risk with me the voyage to the Holy
Tomb?&rdquo; and eight brave kings stepped out, each with a thousand
knights.</p>
<p>Again King Orendel spake out: &ldquo;Where are ye, Dukes and Counts!
who will join me in my voyage for the honour of God and the Holy
Tomb?&rdquo; and a thousand nobles offered.</p>
<p>Once more spake Orendel: &ldquo;Be warned, O Kings, and Knights, and
Nobles! ye will suffer hell&rsquo;s heat and distress before ye reach
the Tomb. Come not unwillingly, nor unarmed.&rdquo; Nothing daunted,
all girded their swords, and prepared for the long journey.</p>
<p>Thus went King Orendel forth from Tr&egrave;ves, surrounded by his
kings and knights, a golden cross grasped firmly in his hand, and the
people cheering. Embarking, he was carried by the Moselle upon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=

<h3 class="main">THE GREAT MASSACRE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Varus, the governor of Gaul, caused so many Christians
to be massacred in Tr&egrave;ves that the Moselle ran red with blood,
until it reached Neumagen. For this he was condemned to ramble
restlessly about the city after his death, and to do deeds of kindness,
assisting every one requiring his aid in Tr&egrave;ves. In this
character he is called &ldquo;the City Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In after days a penitent from Tr&egrave;ves sought absolution from
the Pope. The latter ordered him to fetch a piece of earth from
Tr&egrave;ves; and on the penitent&rsquo;s again presenting himself
with the earth, the Holy Father prayed, and pressed it in his hands,
and blood dropped therefrom immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This blood,&rdquo; said the Holy Father, &ldquo;was shed by
martyrs in <span class="corr" id="xd21e2167" title=

people sent to Rome to pray St. Peter for comfort.</p>
<p>St. Peter gave a staff to the emissaries, and bid them beat upon the
earth where Matern&rsquo;s bones were laid; at the same time they were
to call on him to rise, as it was not yet time for him to rest, but he
must still combat for the sake of God.</p>
<p>This was done; and Matern, who had been dead forty days, arose, and

<h3 class="main">THE FIRST FOUNDLING HOSPITAL.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first institution of this nature is said to have
been in Tr&egrave;ves, and was thus established: Saint Goar was a very
pious man, harming none, but the wicked calumniated him to the Bishop
of Tr&egrave;ves.</p>
<p>The Bishop ordered him to appear before him, and, to test his power,
asked him to declare who was the father of a child that had been
exposed near the Cathedral.</p>
<p>The Saint bending prayed, and touched the child&rsquo;s lips;
whereon the child spoke, and the uttered word was
&ldquo;Rusticus,&rdquo; which was the Bishop&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>The Bishop grew pale, the calumniators slunk away, and St. Goar,
turning to the Bishop, said, &ldquo;Perceivest thou not thy duty? As
the Church embraces with tender arms erring children, so must thou, the
head <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=

</div>
<p>The city of Tr&egrave;ves and surrounding country fell under the
sway of the Archbishops of the diocese, who were usually more warriors
than priests, if we may judge by their acts. Here is a picture of a
brother-Archbishop, who flourished in 1169:&mdash;&ldquo;Christian of
Mayence is said to have spoken six languages, and was celebrated for
his knightly feats of arms. He was daily to be seen with a golden
helmet on his head, armed cap-&agrave;-pi&eacute;, and mounted on his
war-horse, the archiepiscopal mantle floating from his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>shoulders, and in his hand a heavy club, with
which he had brained thirty-eight of his enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were at this time four orders of nobility:&mdash;the
Ecclesiastical, comprising Bishops, Abbots, and other Church
dignitaries. The remaining three orders may be classed as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, the old and proud families who still retained their free
grants of lands; these despised alike Princes and Bishops, Court and
Ecclesiastical dignitaries.</p>
<p>The second order was formed of the nobles belonging to the different
orders of knighthood; these collectively enjoyed the power of
individual princes.</p>
<p>The remaining order consisted of the feudal aristocracy; these were
the court nobility, who filled all the offices of state, and although
bound by oath to support their princes, they were often leagued
together in arms against them.</p>
<p>These four powers were in constant hostility, and from the skirts of
the second and last crept forth a fifth disturbing force; this was made
up of what are ordinarily termed the Robber-Knights, the ruins of whose
castles are frequent on the Moselle and Rhine. In consequence of their
depredations, the princes and nobles were forced to erect strongholds
to protect their towns and villages; hence arose the numerous towers
whose ruins adorn the banks of the Moselle and other rivers.</p>
<p>Most of the later legends are connected with these Robber-Knights;
and the history of their petty wars with the Archbishops of
Tr&egrave;ves and the Counts of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86"
href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>Sponheim (the latter being lords
of a large tract of country), is the history of the Moselle during the
middle ages.</p>
<p>The Counts of Sponheim, too, were generally at variance with the
Archbishops of Tr&egrave;ves, and both these powers with the
Archbishops of Cologne; so we plainly see the necessity of the walls,
which still exist in fragments round the old towns and villages; and
while we quietly sketch the picturesque gate and water-towers, our
minds revert to the days when the poor burghers guarded them with
jealousy.</p>
<p>The burghers eventually, however, carried the day; and as they
increased in power the Robber-Knights were gradually swept away,
leaving only the blackened walls of their old keeps to mark where they
had plied their trade of robbery. See in the following story how the
citizens of Tr&egrave;ves paid off a certain Robber-Knight, named
Adalbert, whose castle was situated near their town, meeting violence
with fraud.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE ANIMATED WINE-CASKS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Adalbert, from his castle of Saint Cross, disturbed by
robbery the city of Tr&egrave;ves. The city swore vengeance.</p>
<p>A certain brave knight, named Sicco, offered to destroy both
Adalbert and his castle by cunning. This offer was gladly accepted, and
the clergy blessed the cunning knight.</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=

<p>On a very hot day, when all within the Saint Cross castle were
dozing, a stranger appeared at the gate, and begged the warder to give
him a cup of wine, as he had travelled far, being just arrived from
Italy, and was on his way to his castle on the Moselle.</p>
<p>The refreshment was given him, and the grateful traveller requested
the warder to tell his master that his kindness would not be
unrewarded, as he was the owner of a fair vineyard, and when he arrived
at home he would send him some casks of his best wine in return for his
hospitality.</p>
<p>Before long a troop of peasants were seen approaching the castle,
escorting several carts laden with casks, which, however, were filled
with armed men instead of strong wine.</p>
<p>The warder challenged the procession, and Sicco, who was disguised
as a peasant, said that they were sent by the pilgrim to whom Adalbert
had been so hospitable, and who now forwarded them in conformity with
his word.</p>
<p>The door was opened, and Adalbert himself conducted the carts into
the court-yard; then Sicco drew his sword, and gave the signal to his
followers by slaying Adalbert, and the men, being liberated from the
casks, rushed on the garrison and slew them all; then the castle was
burnt. On the ruins a church was built.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The Crusades gave a new impetus to arts and sciences, bringing the
luxury and refinement of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>East into contact with the almost
barbaric simplicity of the Western nations; and from the eleventh
century we find the legends assume a different character, saints and
hermits giving place to knights and ladies, and minstrels sing lays of
love and pleasure in place of dwelling on the old themes of war and
religion. Instead of descriptions of lives passed in deserts, and
celestial visions, we have pictures of tournaments and tales of
robbers, ghosts, and stirring adventures of all sorts, mingled with
dreams of Eastern luxury.</p>
<p>Popular fury having been raised by the preaching of Peter the Hermit
and others, it expended itself in the first place on those more
immediately within its reach; and in Tr&egrave;ves the Jews were so
persecuted that they frequently committed suicide, after slaying their
children: multitudes of them also embraced Christianity, only to resume
their real faith when the storm had passed.</p>
<p>In the two succeeding centuries many curious laws were enacted to
suit the times,&mdash;those relating to trial by combat are among the
most remarkable; we will merely instance one: If a woman of the lower
classes had been violated, but the matter could not be proved, the
accused man was buried up to his middle in the earth, and a stick, an
ell long, put into his hand; thus he fought the woman, who was armed
with a stone tied up in her veil.</p>
<p>Coiners were at this period boiled in kettles.</p>
<p>In addition to courts of law, there were now established courts of
love; these were composed of select <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89"
href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>women and knightly poets, who
with extraordinary sagacity gave judgment in love affairs.</p>
<p>The service of the fair formed an essential part of knightly
customs. To insult, or in any way injure a woman, was disgraceful.
Woman&mdash;the ideal of beauty, gentleness, and love&mdash;inflamed
each knightly bosom with a desire to deserve her favours, by deeds of
valour and self-denial. She was worshipped as a protecting divinity,
and knights undertook any task, however difficult, at the merest hint
that it would be acceptable, even deeming themselves happy to die for
her sake, and so win her approbation.</p>
<p>Love became an art, &ldquo;a knightly study,&rdquo; and this
submission to the gentle yoke of woman, bred in humility and religion,
chiefly contributed to humanise and civilise the manners of the age;
and we may thank the German element for superseding the grosser and
more sensual manner in which woman was regarded previously to the
rising of that nation. The historian concludes his remarks on this
subject by saying, &ldquo;Fidelity was the essence of true love; and
such were lovers then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the thirteenth century arose an institution immediately allied
with the neighbourhood of our river; this was the <i>Fehm-gerichte</i>,
or Secret Tribunal. Engelbert, an Archbishop of Cologne, was the first
president and founder of this secret court. It was in the first
instance composed of a number of honourable men of every class, who
joined together for the purpose of judging and punishing all evildoers;
its measures <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>were chiefly directed against the licentious
nobles and robber-knights; its proceedings were necessarily secret, as,
were the names of the judges known, they would have been objects of
vengeance to all the turbulent spirits of the day. In the fourteenth
century this association numbered a hundred thousand members, all bound
by a solemn oath, and known to each other by a secret sign.</p>
<p>No ecclesiastics, except the spiritual lord; no Jews, women, or
servants, were admitted as members; nor were these amenable to the
court, all accused being judged by their peers. Accusations brought
before this court were only such as would not have been received by the
more legal tribunals.</p>
<p>The accused was summoned to appear three times; and if he did not
then come forward, judgment was passed on him by default, the oath of
the accuser being considered sufficient proof of his guilt, and the
condemned criminal was secretly and mysteriously deprived of life. His
body was always found with a dagger, on which were the letters S. S. G.
G.,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2276src" href="#xd21e2276" name=
"xd21e2276src">4</a> plunged into it.</p>
<p>As an instance of the working and rude justice of this tribunal, we
read the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A certain Baron Wolfgang von Cronenburg ravished a nun, and
bade defiance to the laws, in his castle; but even here the arm of this
secret society reached him, and he was found dead. The nun being
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>pregnant by him was released from her vows, and
the possessions of her ravisher bestowed on her and her son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An extraordinary pilgrimage was founded about the end of the
thirteenth century by an Archbishop of Tr&egrave;ves; the pilgrims were
to go to the grave of Saint Willibrod at Epternach, and there join in a
general dance in her honour. During this dance the pilgrims of all
ranks were linked together; first they advanced, then retired,
afterwards ziz-zagging off to the right and left. This custom was kept
up for many years, and is still in existence in a modified
form.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2287src" href="#xd21e2287" name=
"xd21e2287src">5</a></p>
<p>In 1473, Tr&egrave;ves was selected by Charles the Bold and the
Emperor Frederick III. as the place where they should meet and settle
the marriage of Mary of Burgundy with Maximilian, the son of Frederick;
Charles was on his side to be invested with the rank of King, and
receive the title of King of Burgundy.</p>
<p>Frederick arrived, magnificently attended; but Charles, surrounded
by his nobles from the rich country of Flanders, outshone the Emperor.
The latter invested Charles with the Duchy of Guelders, and a day was
fixed for his coronation as King; but before the day arrived Frederick
quietly took boat and dropped down the Moselle, being probably
instigated by the French emissaries<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2295src"
href="#xd21e2295" name="xd21e2295src">6</a> to take this step.</p>
<p>The disgust of Charles defrauded of a crown, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>of the
towns-people disappointed of a spectacle, must have been excessive.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The abuses of the Romish Church now culminated, and Luther, hurling
his bolt against the Roman Bishop, drove the faith of the times into
two opposite extremes,&mdash;infidelity and superstition. Men&rsquo;s
minds became unhinged; none knew what to believe; fantastic visions of
every kind dazzled the eyes of all; the devil seemed to walk on earth,
and men who believed in little else sought his protection. Now was the
time when people believed that certain charms rendered their bodies
invulnerable; and bullets, which never missed, could be cast. Gold was
supposed to be obtainable by skill; and above all, the elixir of life,
which should enable the possessor to lengthen his term of existence at
pleasure, was eagerly sought. One charlatan asserted that gold could be
extracted from Jews, and that the ashes of twenty-four of this nation
would yield one ounce. In the preceding century a Bishop of Lausanne
had believed in the efficacy of a spiritual anathema for driving away
grasshoppers and mice, and soon after a Bishop of Coire cursed
cockchafers.</p>
<p>The burning of witches formed one of the most remarkable features of
the age of the Reformation; it had commenced at an earlier period, but
became general in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century the Council of Tr&egrave;ves condemned the
belief in witches, and declared their supposed nightly expeditions to
be a fabulous invention; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>but in the fifteenth century the
belief came suddenly back with fresh force, Pope Innocent VIII., in
1485, affirming the existence of witches.</p>
<p>Old women were more persecuted by the Lutherans than they had been
by the Inquisition. They were accused of being in league with the
devil, and with his help raising storms, depriving cows of milk,
carrying off corn through the air, striking men and cattle dead, or
afflicting them with sickness, exciting love by potions, and unnatural
hate by spells.</p>
<p>For all these, and many other imaginary crimes, poor old women were
dragged from their homes and subjected to different ordeals. Firstly,
came the shaving of the head; and if any mole or scar was found, she
was proclaimed a witch. Secondly, if no mole or scar, she was usually
tried by either water or weight; if the former, her right thumb was
tied to her left great toe, and her left thumb to her right great toe,
and she was thrown into the water: if she floated, she was a witch; if
weight was the test, little shrivelled-up women had no hope, for they
were generally declared under weight, and tortured till they confessed.
Under these tortures they confessed whatever their persecutors thought
fit, and were then burned. There were many other ordeals practised in
different places.</p>
<p>The Archbishop of Tr&egrave;ves, in 1589, sentenced so many women to
the stake, that in two districts only two women remained. This
Archbishop also condemned the Rector of the University of Tr&egrave;ves
as a sorcerer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century, Tr&egrave;ves suffered
much from the different armies that repeatedly traversed her
territories; and in the beginning of the eighteenth century, one of its
Electors had the temerity to declare war against Louis XIV., without
waiting for the decision of the Empire.</p>
<p>Louis determined to seize on the person of the Elector, who he
jeeringly named the &ldquo;Little Cur&eacute; of Tr&egrave;ves.&rdquo;
For this purpose he despatched a regiment of Hussars from Sarre-Louis,
with orders to bring him dead or alive. The Hussars endeavoured to
surprise the Elector while hunting; but a certain Postmaster warned him
of the plot and he fled to Ehrenbreitstein, closely followed by the
Hussars. The Elector rewarded the Postmaster, by ordering that whenever
he came to Ehrenbreitstein he should be allowed to eat and drink his
fill of whatever he chose, that was in cellar or larder.</p>
<p>In 1803 the spiritual Electorates were abolished, and Tr&egrave;ves
included in France. It now forms a portion of Rhenish Prussia.</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>Having touched on the leading historical events connected with
Tr&egrave;ves, from the earliest times to the present century, we will
take a survey of the city as it now exists.</p>
<p>Formerly Tr&egrave;ves occupied a large space on both sides of the
Moselle, but it has in later years been confined to the right bank of
the river; indeed, it cannot properly be said to be on the Moselle at
all, for the principal part of the town is at some distance inland,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>and everywhere walls shut it out from the stream,
only a few detached houses appearing on the banks.</p>
<p>Completely modernised, Tr&egrave;ves yet possesses a certain look of
age, owing probably to its walls with avenues of trees surrounding, and
an air of decay visible throughout its streets and squares. The later
style of houses are of the time of Louis XV., and many of them are good
specimens of sufficiently ornamented dwellings.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2338width" id="p095"><img src="images/p095.jpg"
alt="" width="468" height="486"></div>
<p>The Market-place presents a most animated appearance on the great
market-days; and it is with difficulty we can force our way through the
crowd on those days, owing to a fashion the women have of wearing their
baskets on their backs; which unwieldy things are unmercifully pushed
into the ribs of the passer-by, and while he tries to recover his
breath after the concussion his incautious foot probably receives a
solid sabot on its tenderest part. In the Market-place stands an
elegant fountain, opposite to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>which is the Rothen Haus, formerly
the town-hall: this building is now a comfortable inn, well placed for
studying costumes and customs.</p>
<p>Within sight of the Market-place is the famous Porta Nigra; what its
original use was is a matter of vague conjecture, the learned in such
subjects not being able to agree in their opinions. During the middle
ages it was used for ecclesiastical purposes, and was fitted up as two
churches, one above the other, in which service was regularly
performed: the Prussian authorities have restored it to its original
state, and it is very well preserved, and is certainly quite one of the
most interesting Roman buildings extant.</p>
<p>There are (as we stated at the commencement of this chapter) many
other reminiscences of the Roman rule to be seen in Tr&egrave;ves, the
principal of which are the bridge, the amphitheatre, and the baths: of
the latter a considerable portion still remains, but of the
amphitheatre only the form is left, with a mere fragment of wall at the
entrance. It, in common with the other ruins in Tr&egrave;ves, is well
kept and preserved.</p>
<p>The old palace of the Archbishops is now a barrack, and only
interesting from its associations.</p>
<p>The Liebfrauen Kirche is a beautiful Gothic edifice, with noble
arches of extreme lightness and delicacy of appearance; the doorway is
richly carved; and, altogether, this church is as beautiful a specimen
of its order of architecture as can be found. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Cathedral is a fine building and stands side by side with the
Liebfrauen Kirche, which it far exceeds in size but to which it is
inferior in beauty; it is, nevertheless, a good specimen of the
Byzantine style, and from its proximity to the Liebfrauen Kirche we are
able, at a glance, to contrast the different orders of
architecture.</p>
<p>In this Cathedral is deposited the coat of our Saviour, &ldquo;woven
without seam from top to the bottom;&rdquo; and here flocked, so lately
as 1844, no less than one million one hundred thousand persons to gaze
on the wonderful garment, which was exhibited to the <i>faithful</i>
for eight weeks and then returned to its coffer.</p>
<p>There are many other churches in and around Tr&egrave;ves, one of
which the commissionaires think very grand, and accordingly march their
slaves, the sight-seers, off to visit it, and expect them to fall into
raptures with a whitewashed, high-roofed ball-room, covered with
tawdry, coarsely-painted arabesques, and indifferent pictures; the
slaves generally gratify their tyrants by falling into unbounded
raptures, and nearly twist their necks off to get a look at the
paintings on the ceiling: latterly, little looking-glasses have been
provided, to save them from getting cricks in their necks.</p>
<p>About six miles from Tr&egrave;ves, on the Luxembourg road, is a
village called Igel. Here is preserved a very curious stone obelisk,
covered with carvings of figures and inscriptions: as usual, there is a
considerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>dispute as to its origin and purpose, but it
undoubtedly is a very curious relic of bygone days, and is not without
beauty in design and execution.</p>
<p>Luxembourg is a very strong place, so scientifically fortified that
it is most difficult for an uninitiated person to find his way into it;
and having done so, the town is so wretchedly stupid and dull that the
visitor generally comes to the conclusion that he has taken a good deal
of trouble for nothing, and hastens to make his way out: which task he
finds not less difficult than the entry. From the walls very striking
views might be seen, only the sentries order you off immediately,
especially if you have so deadly an implement as a sketch-book in your
hand; however, we have no particular cause to expatiate on Luxembourg,
as it is only one small feeder of our river.</p>

<p>That portion of our river which lies between Tr&egrave;ves and
Coblence is the most beautiful, and the part usually visited by the few
who allow themselves the enjoyment of seeing scenery yet unspoiled by
Art. The Moselle at this present time is much what the Rhine was half a
century ago. No great roads line the banks, cutting off the quaint
houses of the old towns and villages from the river-side; and the towns
and villages themselves are, with some few exceptions, far more
picturesque than those on the Rhine. Their old water-towers and walls
still lave their bases in the stream, as those of St.
Goarshausen-on-Rhine did until a few years back, when the new road
drove them inland.</p>
<p>In places where the rocks approach closely to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>river, the usual arrangement of the houses is in
one long street, with behind it ruined towers perched at intervals upon
the ascending walls, which straggle through the vineyards, till the
rise becomes too sudden for them to climb or intruders to pass over.
Where the space is larger, the houses are clustered among walnut-trees,
which grow to an immense size. Perhaps the greatest charm of all in
descending our river is the absence of those swarms of mere sight-seers
who infest the Rhine,&mdash;the trifling discomforts of a more
unfrequented route being sufficient to deter these garrulous
butterflies from &ldquo;doing&rdquo; the Moselle; and as yet Murray has
not given in detail the number of turrets to each castle on this river,
for eager watchers to &ldquo;tell off&rdquo; as the steamer breasts the
stream. Still it is remarkable how few of all those that pass the mouth
of the Moselle at Coblence ascend its waters.</p>
<p>We now invite those who cannot in person see &ldquo;the blue
Moselle&rdquo; to embark their minds in our skiff, and as we glide
along we will tell them tales of the old time, when the ruined towers
above our heads clanged with the tramp of armed men, and echoed to
songs of love and wine.</p>
<p>Tr&egrave;ves and its bridge are shut out by the trees, and the
river nymphs surround us with garlands and with song.</p>

<p class="first">The little incidents seen on the banks of the river as
we move along are eminently picturesque, and give life and reality to
what we should otherwise almost <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102"
href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>imagine to be a dream of
beauty, rather than real actual scenes, where toil and labour are at
work. Such foregrounds, too, for artists! Here is a woman mowing:
further down, one impels a heavy boat along by means of a pole: there
red cows stand, half in the water, half on a grassy slope, with the
reflected green of which their red contrasts. Again, as we approach a
village, some of the maidens are seen drawing water; while others, in
groups and attitudes that present endless studies, wash their gay
clothing, or bleach long strips of brownish linen.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2472width" id="p102"><img src="images/p102.jpg"
alt="" width="491" height="397"></div>
<p>Boat-building is carried on at nearly every village, and the smoke
from the accompanying fire wreathes among the walnut-trees. In reality,
the people work hard; but it is difficult to divest our minds of the
idea that they are merely sauntering about, and forming groups for
their own amusement and the delight of others. All is so complete in
loveliness, that it seems unreal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103"
href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>The ribs of the great flat-bottomed boats look like skeletons of
some curious animal, which the apparent loungers are examining at their
ease; and the nearly completed barge seems to be a sort of
summer-house, in which the idler can sit, or under which he may smoke
his pipe in the shade,&mdash;for, of course, all smoke. Usually the
long stem with the earthenware or china bowl is the medium by which the
fragrant weed is inhaled, but sometimes a few inches of coarse stick
(in appearance) is the substitute.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2480width" id="p103"><img src="images/p103.jpg"
alt="Boat-building." width="720" height="355">
<p class="figureHead">Boat-building.</p>
</div>
<p>These boats, when finished, are used for all sorts of purposes. The
want of good roads, and the fact of the stream being less rapid than
that of the Rhine, as well as the absence of steam-tugs, makes the
Moselle more lively with barges and small boats, especially the latter;
though, of course, there being only three or four steamers on the whole
distance (about 150 miles) between Tr&egrave;ves and Coblence, the
absence of those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span>puffing drawbacks to tranquil enjoyment
renders the Moselle more quiet on the whole.</p>
<p>The larger barges carry iron, earthenware, charcoal, bark, wine, and
general cargoes; while the smaller ones are filled with market produce
of all sorts going to be sold in the larger towns, and numbers of these
small boats are kept at each village for the residents to cross to
their farms or vineyards on the opposite bank. There are also
ferry-boats, large enough for carts and oxen, or horses, at nearly
every cluster of houses.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2492width" id="p104"><img src="images/p104.jpg"
alt="Boat-building." width="720" height="320">
<p class="figureHead">Boat-building.</p>
</div>
<p>Often watching these great boats with their miscellaneous lading, or
waiting our own turn to cross, we have been struck by the contrast
between the young fair children with flaxen hair and the careworn
countenances of the parents, whose skin is nearly as brown as that of a
Maltese boatman, his approaching to claret-colour. The peasantry are,
as far as we could judge or learn, a simple, contented race, working
hard, and in bad seasons ill-fed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"

<p class="first">The different seasons of the year, of course, bring
different incidents on our river into existence, each in its proper
turn. The hay-harvest is a very lively time <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>upon
its banks; everywhere the green slopes are rid of their superfluous
load, and boats cross and recross the river with the sweet-scented
cargoes, some of which are stored, some transferred to larger bottoms
for transportation down the stream.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2566width" id="p106-1"><img src=
"images/p106-1.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="218"></div>
<p>Later comes the corn-harvest, then the boats are freighted with the
golden ears; soon after an equally busy time sets in, when every sort
of boat is seen piled with small branches of the oak: the leaves are
stripped from the branches so brought home, and, being carefully dried,
they form an excellent material with which the people stuff their
mattresses, this making, as they assert, much warmer and softer beds,
than straw. Every village possesses a right of cutting bedding at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>some place, and the different inhabitants have
days allotted them by the authorities, on which they may help
themselves.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2573width" id="p106-2"><img src=
"images/p106-2.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="236"></div>
<p>The winter draws near and the vintage sets in, then all boats are
employed on this absorbing service; the little boats, with large casks
on board, look in the distance very much like gondolas: wherever the
eye rests, nothing is seen that has not some connexion with the great
event of the year on the Moselle. However, the vintage has a chapter to
itself, so we will not dwell upon it here.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2578width" id="p107"><img src="images/p107.jpg"
alt="" width="464" height="286"></div>
<p>Carrying firewood is the last great occupation of the year for the
smaller boats, and it is well for those who can procure a good supply
of fuel, for the winter is cold and severe; unfortunately, too, wood is
very scarce and dear, and though somewhat cheaper on the Moselle than
in most parts of Germany, yet a good fire is quite out of the reach of
the poorer classes, and they scrape together every morsel to enable
them to feed the iron stoves which warm their cottages. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>The river is in parts so shallow that breakwaters are built out from
the banks, in order to deepen the centre of the stream; this, of
course, makes the water run swifter, and it requires great toil of many
horses to tug the barges up the stream. Floating down these rapids is
agreeable enough, and the descent is made with very little labour,
towns and villages succeeding each other on the banks, the approaches
to them being lined with fruit-trees, of which the walnut and cherry
are the most conspicuous.</p>
<p>The cherries are excellent, and so plentiful that children will
often refuse a handful when offered, having previously gorged
themselves at home. Numbers are exported, going by river to Coblence,
and so on down the Rhine.</p>
<p>Apricots are also abundant in good seasons. They are grown on
standard trees.</p>
<p>Garden produce of all sorts abounds, and apples and pears drop
unheeded to the ground.</p>
<p>Through incidents like these, on bank and river, we glide on. We
have, perhaps, halted during the midday heat at some inviting spot,
where the cool shadows reposed beneath the walnuts; now the evening
draws near, and rounding a corner, our resting-place for the night
appears. The thin mist rising from the river obscures the base of the
church, whose sharply-pointed spire is conspicuous above the trees;
lights fall in tremulous lines from the high windows, and in the air is
the sound of&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"

</div>
<p>From Tr&egrave;ves to Trittenheim the scenery of our river, although
very pleasing, has not yet attained to its full beauty; the Moselle,
woman as she has become, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>is still scarcely matured in
beauty; many charms are hers already, but until approaching Neumagen
her life does not reach the fulness of its summer glory. Then, indeed,
the full enchantment of her beauty breaks upon us, as, often in life,
we have been in the habit of seeing a lovely girl pass from childhood
into the graces of early womanhood, we admire and love; but at some
future day we suddenly perceive that the lovely girl has become a
glorious woman, replete with every grace. The change seems to take
place in a day, even in an hour: some incident, trifling perchance in
itself, has awoke the spirit, and the lately shy and timid girl has
become a woman in spirit as in name; losing none of the happy
loveliness of her earlier years, she has acquired a dignity and
nameless, indefinable grace, which completes her beauty and robs us of
our hearts.</p>
<p>Such has our Moselle become when she winds among the mountains past
Neumagen and Piesport.</p>
<p>The promontory at the back of Neumagen is divided into two parts by
the little river Drohn. It is supposed by many that it was on the bank
of this little stream that the celebrated Palace of the Thirty Towers
stood. This palace, built by the Archbishop Nicetius of Tr&egrave;ves,
is supposed to have been most beautiful, and formed entirely of marble,
with pleasure-grounds sloping to the stream and river. The description
given of these gardens by the poet, Venantius Fortunatus, reads more
like an Eastern account of those gardens of Paradise sometimes for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>a moment unveiled to the wanderer in the Arabian
desert. Bishofstein (lower down the stream) also claims the honour of
being on the site of the Palace of the Thirty Towers, but it does not
in any way answer the description. Whether the banks of the Drohn were
the site of this marble palace or not, the beauty of the situation
certainly gives it a claim to have been so, and the Archbishops did
possess a country-house near Neumagen.</p>
<p>A few miles below Tr&egrave;ves we pass Pfalzel, which lies on the
left bank; this little town is interesting, as it is said to be the
site of the beautiful legend of Genoveva, handed down to us in so many
different versions.</p>

attentions the lady had repulsed, plotted how he might ruin her in her
lord&rsquo;s esteem.</p>
<p>To this end he poisoned the Pfalz-graf&rsquo;s mind against his
virtuous wife, and so, deeming her guilty of crimes she never even
imagined, her lord drove Genoveva from his castle, that so she might be
slain of wild beasts or die of hunger.</p>
<p>Genoveva, as she passed out from the castle gates, threw her
wedding-ring into the water, that so the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>crime of her lord
might be lessened, as he was thus released from the marriage-tie.</p>
<p>Time passed on, and Siegfried, being on a hunting excursion, wished
for food and rest; he therefore ordered a tent to be pitched on the
banks of a stream. No sooner was this done than two fishermen arrived
with a great fish, which they presented to the Pfalz-graf; the fish
being opened, a ring was found, which the Pfalz-graf no sooner saw than
he perceived it was that of his dead wife.</p>
<p>Returning home he was much troubled at this circumstance, and
falling asleep he dreamt that he saw a dragon persecuting Genoveva, who
still was dearer to him than all the world beside. He related this
dream to Golo, who pacified him for a time: but again he dreamt, and in
his dream he hunted a pure white hind, following, and persecuting it
remorselessly; awaking, he felt that the hind was Genoveva, and he was
indeed a cruel huntsman, who had chased a spotless deer to death.</p>
<p>He ordered everything to be prepared for the chase,&mdash;why, he
knew not, but felt the dream must be followed out; Golo was seized with
agony when the Pfalz-graf set forth, and secretly followed his
master&rsquo;s steps.</p>
<p>A spotless hind was found, and the Pfalz-graf eagerly followed on
her track, wounding her with an arrow; on sped the hind, until, with a
last bound, it forced its way through the bushes, and fell bleeding and
exhausted at Genoveva&rsquo;s feet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>Siegfried followed close, and threw himself on his knees before his
injured wife, who had been wonderfully preserved from death, and,
together with the child to which she had given birth, nourished by the
poor deer, which now was dying of her wounds.</p>
<p>Pointing to her babe, Genoveva showed that in every feature it was
the counterpart of her lord: thus was Golo&rsquo;s treachery made
manifest, and his head, being struck from off the body, was exposed
upon the castle walls.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Another legend of Pfalzel tells of a wicked nun, who, by the
devil&rsquo;s aid, worked a magic garment and presented it to the
Archbishop; immediately on putting it on horrible desires seized on
him, and he felt as if the fiend were dragging him to perdition.
Throwing it off, others tried it, and on all it had the same effect;
being therefore convinced of the iniquity of the worker, the Archbishop
turned the nun out of the convent, but finding that her sister nuns
were as bad as she, he was compelled to treat them all in a similar
manner: the garment, however, still exists, and is worn by many.</p>
<p>Inland of Pfalzel is Rammstein, where a certain Count of Vianden
(like Adalbert of St. Cross) came to an untimely end by an overfondness
for wine. He had once taken the Bishop prisoner and put him into
fetters; this the latter never forgot or forgave, so, knowing the
Count&rsquo;s fondness for wine, he, one very sultry day, sent a string
of carts filled with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115"
name="pb115">115</a>]</span>barrels past the walls of the Count&rsquo;s
strong castle; down swooped the Count&rsquo;s followers, like beasts of
prey as they were, and carried off the convoy; then they all set to
work drinking, in the true German fashion.</p>
<p>While thus carousing, the armed followers of the Bishop suddenly
surprised them, and the castle was taken and burnt; the Bishop shouted
to the Count, who in his turn was put in fetters, &ldquo;Behold the
consequence of raising thy hand against the Lord&rsquo;s
anointed!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Near Pfalzel several brooks run into the Moselle; one on the same
bank, named the Kill, passes Rammstein, and flowing through a charming
valley, waters a large strip of most productive garden-ground, which
extends from the Moselle to some distance inland.</p>
<p>These lateral valleys are very frequent on our river. We can
scarcely wander along her banks for a quarter of a mile but a recess in
the neighbouring hills is seen, through which a little stream comes
dancing. Penetrating into the gorge we find busy little mills at work,
and are led into scenery which at every turn seems to increase in
beauty. We shall hereafter have to describe some of these lateral
valleys, so need not now dwell on their delights.</p>
<p>On the opposite shore, which is watered by another stream, is
Gr&uuml;nhaus, and above it Gr&uuml;neberg. From these vineyards come
the most highly-prized wines of the Moselle, though many think the
wines of Zeltingen more delicate in flavour. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>Past little islands, and through rich fields filled with garden
produce, we glide on, following the serpentine course of our river. The
wood-embosomed villages peep at us as we go by, each group of houses
has its church rising in the midst: gradually the banks grow steeper,
hills swell up inland, and here and there come down to look on the
Moselle. These reconnoiterers retire, and having told their chiefs of
the approach of the glorious stream, at Trittenheim we find the right
bank covered with mountain-giants, come to do homage to the spirit of
the waters.</p>
<p>At Trittenheim is one of those flying bridges, almost peculiar to
the Moselle. It is thus formed: two strong towers are built, one on
each side of the stream; from the summits of these towers, attached to
great posts built into the solid wall, stretches a rope, which falls in
a curve over the river; a stout cord attached to a swivel, which runs
freely along the rope, descends to the surface of the river, and to it
is fastened a barge, which propelled by the action of the swift running
stream, and guided by the boatman, passes from side to side at his
pleasure, carrying heavy loads, with little labour to the ferryman.</p>
<p>Where the breadth of the river admits, these sort of flying bridges
are used; in other parts, those with which the reader is probably
familiar on the Rhine are in operation; and again, where the stream is
sluggish, barges unattached to any rope are poled up stream, and
floated across.</p>
<p>Trittenheim was the birth-place of the celebrated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>Trithemius, famous for his many writings and his
learning. He, in common with all learned men of his time (end of
fifteenth century), was considered a sorcerer, and the Emperor
Maximilian applied to him to raise the spirit of his deceased wife,
Mary of Burgundy. This he is said to have done, and the dead Princess
reappeared in all the charms of her youthful beauty: but a more
probable account of this transaction is given in the following version,
taken from the beautiful poem in the <i lang="de">Mosel sagen</i>.</p>

<h3 class="main">TRITHEMIUS AND THE EMPEROR.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One very dark night a man wrapped in a mantle, so as
to conceal his features, entered the cloister at Spanheim, and demanded
to see the Abbot.</p>
<p>Trithemius (the Abbot) advanced to meet his visitor, who he
immediately recognised as the Emperor Maximilian. The Emperor requested
him to raise the shade of his first wife, Mary; upon which Trithemius
took him by the hand, and leading him out of doors, pointed to two
bright constellations in the form of staves, which were shining in the
sky, and addressed him as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see there, my Prince, the two principles of government;
by ruling with the one, bad princes beat down their subjects beneath
their feet, and cause those little stars, which represent drops of
blood and tears, to flow; in that garden where the seeds of time are
ripening, this staff will stand like a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>parched trunk, but
the other staff will flourish green as a palm-tree, unhurt by the heat
of the summer&rsquo;s day; for this last is a righteous sceptre, a
staff of pure gold, serving to support and strengthen those who lean
trustfully upon it, and use it to benefit their subjects. Choose, then,
O Monarch, with which staff thou wilt rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Priest thus spoke another star shone forth, and directing
the Emperor&rsquo;s attention towards it, Trithemius again addressed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, O King, a young and smiling face beam from the
newly-risen star. Tearless and blissfully it smiles on you, wearing the
look of your glorified wife. Pain and tears are left behind her in the
grave, on which they blossom like pale roses. Mary beckons to you from
on high to join her in the gardens of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose, then, thy sceptre, O Prince. Erect to thy loved wife
a monument of deeds. To act is a ruler&rsquo;s duty. We priests
<i>have</i> had bestowed upon us a magic virtue; it consists in wiping
away your tears, and animating you to tread the right path with the
sceptre of blessings in your hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be strong, be wise, my Prince, and receive my blessing on
your noble path. Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince, perceiving the value of the counsel he had received,
departed through the night, which now was luminous, with the words of
truth.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The promontory on which Trittenheim is situated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>is
clothed with fruit-trees, and rivals in fertility the opposite shore,
on which, a little lower down, Neumagen is situated.</p>
<p>Before reaching Neumagen we pass a little chapel, erected at the
spot where, according to tradition, the waters of the Moselle ceased to
be tinged with the blood shed at Tr&egrave;ves in the massacre of
Christian martyrs.</p>
<p>Neumagen enjoys a most agreeable site. Sheltered by the hills which
rise at its back, it faces the bold cliffs that now have arisen on the
left bank of our river. On ascending the hills at the back of the town
we find ourselves on a level platform, with the Moselle on one side of
us and the Drohn on the other; beyond these, other table-lands swell
into hills, and varied outlines of distant mountains curve into the
sky.</p>
<p>On this elevated table-land a refreshing breeze blows, even on the
most sultry days, and the tender blue lines of the receding hills give
an air of coolness which is delicious to the heated pedestrian. Such
variety of scenery as the walking tourist meets on the Moselle is
scarcely to be exceeded; hill and dale, mountain, river, wood, and
plain, all are there combining their charms.</p>
<p>It was over these hills that Constantine was marching when, at break
of day,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2751src" href="#xd21e2751" name=
"xd21e2751src">1</a> the fiery cross appeared in the sky, with the
inscription, &ldquo;<i lang="la">In hoc vince.</i>&rdquo; Wonder arose
in the minds of Constantine and his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>legions, but none
could interpret the meaning of the celestial sign. At night, in a
dream, Constantine saw Jesus with a cross in his arms, like to that he
had seen in the heavens; and the vision commanded him to attach a mark
of the same form to his standard, telling him that by so doing he
should vanquish all his enemies.</p>
<p>Arriving at Tr&egrave;ves, Constantine, mindful of his dream and the
celestial sign, called together cunning artificers; and a cross,
surmounted with a crown of gold and jewels, was set upon the lance from
which the purple standard of royalty floated.</p>
<p>And all his enemies were conquered, in accordance with the words
spoken to him in his dream. So Christianity triumphed over
idolatry.</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>Walking across the promontory that lies between Neumagen and
Piesport, we found the ground covered with the delicate autumn crocus,
whose jewels sparkled among the grass; and apples, with their ruddy
hues, lay beneath the trees, from which they had abundantly fallen.</p>
<p>Piesport is confined by the mountain at its back to one narrow,
straggling street; it possesses a handsome church, from which we saw,
soon after our arrival, issue forth a long procession. First came men,
two and two, clad in blue frocks; then children, followed by women in
like order; these preceded the old priest and choristers; then again
came men; and, lastly, old women. The procession wound its chanting
stream along, round the little town, and returning, made the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>circuit of the church and re-entered the
edifice. The object of the ceremony was to charm rain from the sky by
their chanting. The performers and assisters ill the scene gossiped and
chatted to each other in the intervals of singing, and the poor old
priest seemed quite wearied, and glad to return to his church. The
singing did not in any way influence the weather, certainly for some
weeks.</p>
<p>The mountain behind Piesport is entirely covered with vineyards.
These celebrated vineyards were considered the best on the Moselle in
the earlier part of last century; but having gained this reputation for
their wine, the cultivators introduced a worse sort of grape, which
bore more fruit, in order to make a greater quantity of wine; but,
fortunately for the place, a new Cur&eacute;, who was appointed in
1770, induced them to restore the old sort of vine, and thus regain the
reputation they were rapidly losing.</p>
<p>Having succeeded in getting up nearly to the summit of the mountain
without <i lang="fr">un coup de soleil</i>, we got among groves of
picturesquely-formed oak, many of the trees being of considerable size.
Throwing ourselves down beneath their grateful shade, a fine view of
the surrounding district is before us. This view we have endeavoured to
lay before our readers in the vignette at the head of the chapter. The
spire of the church at Piesport is seen cutting against the bed of the
river, and the peep of distance gives a good idea of the peculiar
formation of the hills.</p>
<p>The hills of the Moselle are not hills in the ordinary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>acceptation of the word, as they all form part
of a high table-land, which extends from near here to beyond
Andernach-on-Rhine, on the left bank, and on the right to Bingen. The
range on the right bank are called the Hunsruck mountains; that on the
left bank, the Eifel. Through the great table-land thus formed flow the
Rhine and Moselle; thus the banks of both rivers are very similar in
formation, and average about the same height: but the Moselle, being a
much smaller river, of course her banks appear more mountainous; the
ranges also approach nearer to the stream, and the lateral valleys are
far more frequent.</p>
<p>It is astonishing at first, after climbing unceasingly for an hour,
to find one&rsquo;s self standing on a gently undulating plain waving
with grain, and forest-trees growing in masses. The river is then seen
to be in a gorge, worn by the perpetual action of her waters, and we
have only attained to the natural level of the country.</p>
<p>This level is, however, broken by many other gorges, each containing
its stream, bounding downwards to our river. Towards the horizon also
(as we have mentioned in describing the view above Neumagen) the
table-land generally rises into higher ranges; thus there is never any
monotony about the scenery, which is enlivened by the spires of
churches, and busy labourers at work in what seemed to us like Jack and
the Bean-stalk&rsquo;s country. It so strongly resembles the
description given, where the immortal Jack climbs up and up his
bean-stalk, until at length he arrives at the level of a new world.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>In autumn, when the weeds, &amp;c. are being burnt, the scenes on
this table-land are very striking. Far as the eye can reach wreathe up
the columns of white smoke, spreading a purifying smell of burning, and
wrapping the view in a filmy veil that increases its beauty.</p>
<p>The name of Piesport is derived from Pipini Portus, the place having
been thus called from being an <i>allod</i> of the Carlovingian house,
of which Pepin was the founder.</p>
<p>Clausen, which lies at a short distance from Piesport, contains a
miraculous picture of the Virgin, which was originally brought from
Tr&egrave;ves by the zealous Saint Eberhard, whose hermitage stood in
the forest.</p>
<p>The Saint built a chapel, and in it he placed this wonderful
picture: here many miracles were performed; on one occasion a paralytic
man was completely restored to the use of his limbs: he threw away his
crutches, and walked home, no longer requiring the horse that had
brought him.</p>
<p>The miracles wrought in the Saint&rsquo;s little chapel gave great
offence to the constituted Priest of Clausen, and eventually the
picture was removed to his church; but it ceased to perform miracles,
its virtue was gone, and now it is only regarded with veneration on
account of its former celebrity.</p>
<p>Having now arrived in the heart of the wine-district, we will
proceed to give some little account of the vintage, which occupies all
attention and employs all hands in these parts. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, with the merry peasants, we will sing the praise of their good
genius:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the Moselle the vintage is still conducted in the old-fashioned
way, much of the wine being still pressed from the bunches by the feet.
The clusters, which have been carefully cut from the trees, are placed
in the baskets (which the people seem always to wear on their backs),
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>borne down the hill-side to the village, where
they are tumbled into great tubs, in which they are crushed, if not by
the feet, by wooden mallets.</p>
<p>The long toil of carrying up great basketsful of dressing for the
roots, of hacking round the vines, of carefully tying up the boughs and
tending them in every possible way, repairing the walls and steps, and
placing beneath the fruit-bunches flat stones to refract the heat on to
their lower sides, is ended; all having prospered, joy is at its
height, for plenty will fill the homes of the cultivators during the
coming winter.</p>
<p>The peasantry suffer great hardships in bad years; and,
unfortunately, these more frequently recur than good.</p>
<p>Having, week after week, toiled up and down the nearly perpendicular
cliffs, and worked amid their vineyards unmindful alike of sun and
rain, it is very sad to think that generally the gain is small for so
much labour; and even in good years, although the peasantry benefit
considerably, yet it is not they, but the wine-buyers, who make the
principal profit.</p>
<p>In every village may be seen one or two houses, evidently occupied
by a class far above the peasantry. To these houses are attached large
cellars, through whose open doors we sometimes see great casks piled
up; the owners of these dwellings are small merchants, who buy up the
grapes from the poorer people, paying by the weight. They are the real
gainers by a good year, for they rule the prices of the market; and by
advancing sums when necessary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>to the peasants, the latter
are in a measure bound to accommodate them. That all do benefit is,
however, an undoubted fact; and the happy vintage-time is the most
joyful season of the year upon our river&rsquo;s banks.</p>

<p class="first">The whole course of the Moselle is more or less
sheeted with vineyards. Wherever a shelf of rock is accessible, or can
be made so, there are the vines. Within the old walls of the mouldering
castles are vineyards; upon the nearly level ground are fields of
vines; hanging from every wall, and climbing round every window, are
the rich green leaves and graceful tendrils of this wine-giving plant.
And yet there is no sameness; from the peculiar formation of the hills
there is always some outjutting crag or overhanging precipice, with
roof of trees, to break the lines of the vineyards. Great masses of
forest still remain in many places, reserved for fire-wood and other
purposes: the vineyards, too, are for the most part formed of old
vines; their foliage, consequently, is more luxuriant. Owing to these
reasons the vine does not assume on the Moselle that monotonous
appearance that it presents in many parts of the Rhine, and generally
in France. Interspersed with the vines are numbers of wild flowers, of
which the white convolvulus is the most conspicuous; its graceful
flower contrasts beautifully with the deep rich green of the supporting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>plant, and where the vines festoon, wreaths of
unsurpassed loveliness are formed.</p>
<p>Piesport is considered the centre of the wine district, and its wine
bears a high reputation, though other names bear a higher price, and a
few of the wines are better flavoured. Almost all the Moselle wine is
white, and has a scented flavour and exquisite <i>bouquet</i>; it is
thought by many superior to Rhine wine, but it will not bear transport
so well.</p>
<p>Even the most ordinary table-wine has generally a sparkling
freshness, most grateful to the drinker, as it assuages his thirst much
better than other wines; but what we term &ldquo;sparkling
Moselle&rdquo; is only to be obtained in Tr&egrave;ves or Coblence, and
even then it is not like our idea of that wine: therefore it must, like
port and sherry, be prepared expressly to suit English palates.</p>
<p>Some of the red wine is tolerable, but not to be compared to the red
wines of the Rhine and the Ahr valley; it has something of the
roughness of the latter, but not its flavour.</p>
<p>They have in many places in Germany what is termed the &ldquo;Grape
Cure.&rdquo; The season for this begins as soon as the grapes are ripe
enough to be eaten; and the cure consists simply in munching as many
bunches as the patient can possibly swallow,&mdash;about fourteen
pounds being considered a fair day&rsquo;s eating for one person:
nothing else is to be taken. Whether this cramming cures the patient of
anything but love for grapes is doubtful; but it must have that effect,
so it is perhaps properly called &ldquo;Grape Cure.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>Little paths lead up to the hill-sides through the vineyards. Often
steps in the solid rock have had to be cut, and the labour and
perseverance must have been immense. When the vintage approaches, these
paths are closed by great bundles of thorn, and other signs and marks
are put up to warn off intruders.</p>
<p>In bad years more vinegar is made than wine; often even they do not
attempt to make the latter.</p>
<p>The completion of the vintage is celebrated as it began, by firing
and shouting, dancing and singing, and then the toil of tending the
vines recommences; but if the season has been propitious, the result
may be easily read in the features of the peasants, which are now for a
time released from the anxious contracted look they wore through the
summer and earlier part of the autumn.</p>
<p>So much in celebration of wine; but, ever mindful of our beautiful
Moselle, we will close this vintage chapter, with its praise of wine,
with a few lines in praise of water, and thus preserve that happy
balance between the two fluids which is the true secret of enjoyment.
Both are good; both are gifts to be rightly used and thankfully
enjoyed: but if the palm is to be given to one over the other, it
should not be to the usurper Wine, who generally sits upon his
sister&rsquo;s throne.</p>

<p>A little below Piesport the course of our river is obstructed by a
huge mass of nearly perpendicular rock, descending so abruptly into the
water, that no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>path can be made round its base. From the top of
this tremendous rock the best view on the whole river is obtained. From
there the eye can follow the windings of the stream as it serpentines
through the hills, for many miles.</p>
<p>Unable to force her way through, the river bends off to the right,
and wins by concession what she cannot gain by force, affording a
lesson to her sex; teaching them to encircle by affection, instead of
battling against the rock. By the latter course she <i>may</i> at
length succeed in her desires, but not without fretting and chafing the
hard rock, causing many a line upon its once smooth brow; and, finally,
when the way is worn, the passage forced, will not the sullen rock for
ever hang, darkening with its shadow the stream conqueror, and
threatening to fall and overwhelm the persevering brawler? while, by
the course here taken, the glad wave circles with her bright arms the
lordly rock, and the sunlight on his face is reflected in her bosom;
while the light from her gay, happy breast, is thrown back upon his
manly front.</p>
<p>At this corner, too, the tree-groups teach us the same lesson;
repeated and beautified by the tender water hues, they, in lending
beauty to the stream, enhance their own, and give another of the
innumerable instances in which by nature we are shown how all things
are adapted and suited to their several stations; and, by aiding and
assisting one another, increase their own beauty or usefulness: thus
should it be in life. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=

<p>On the promontory which we are now leaving behind us on the right
are several little villages, of which Emmel is the principal. It is
celebrated for a schism which took place there.</p>
<p>In 1790, the Directory at Paris wished the Cur&eacute; of Emmel to
take the same oath they had compelled the French clergy to pronounce;
and on receiving the Cur&eacute;&rsquo;s refusal, he was proscribed.
All his flock accompanied the Cur&eacute; on his being driven forth,
until he thus addressed them: &ldquo;I quit you, but my spirit will
always remain with you. At Bornhofen, whither I now go, I shall say the
mass every morning at nine, and you can in spirit join in the
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all promised so to do; and every day at nine the people
collected in the church, and said their prayers without a
Cur&eacute;.</p>
<p>After some years the Cur&eacute; died, and a new one was appointed,
but the people of Emmel persisted in saying their prayers by themselves
without any assistance; and, in spite of all remonstrances, many
families remained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span>schismatics until a few years back. It is
doubtful whether they have all returned to their former allegiance,
even at the present time.</p>
<p>Round the pebbly bed in which our river sings along her course where
her banks widen, then again beneath impending cliffs, we hurry on, past
Minnheim, Rondel, Winterich, and other little nests of vitality, from
which the labourers come forth to cultivate the fertile soil.</p>
<p>Two pretty legends are told of this district; the first is called
&ldquo;The Cell of Eberhard;&rdquo; the second, &ldquo;The Blooming
Roses;&rdquo; and there is an evident connexion between the two.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE CELL OF EBERHARD.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A mother, being provoked, said to her unoffending
child, &ldquo;Go off to the devil!&rdquo; The poor girl, frightened,
wandered into the woods, then covered with snow.</p>
<p>Soon the mother, growing calm, became anxious about her child, and
sought her everywhere, but she could not be found: lamenting, she wept
all night.</p>
<p>At daybreak she arose, and induced her neighbours to join her in her
search; but no tracks were found in the freshly-fallen snow.</p>
<p>The mother then sought Eberhard&rsquo;s Cell, and wept and prayed
till four days and nights had passed. She now requested the priest to
say a mass for her lost child. No sooner had the priest raised the Host
on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>high, than a tender voice sounding from the
forest said, &ldquo;Your little girl yet lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out sprang the mother, and there, beneath the trees, she found her
little daughter, a nosegay of summer flowers in one hand and a green
twig in the other. With tears of joy the mother clasped her, and asked
her how she had been preserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mother,&rdquo; replied the child, &ldquo;has always been
with me. Dear mother carried a light, and with her ran a little dog,
white as the snow, and <i>so</i> faithful and kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the mother perceived that the Virgin had guarded her child; and
she led the little girl into Eberhard&rsquo;s Cell, where they offered
the wreath at the Virgin&rsquo;s shrine.</p>
<p>Still blossoms the wreath, embalmed by love and thankful prayer.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE BLOOMING ROSES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Within the forest stood a little chapel, in which was
a statue of the Virgin. Hither came a young girl, and day by day
adorned it with fresh flowers. From the Madonna&rsquo;s arms the infant
Jesus smiled upon the child. Thus passed the spring and summer. The
girl, devoted to her occupation, and her heart filled with love for
Jesus, thought less and less upon the things of this world. One thought
alone troubled her as the autumn advanced; this was, that in winter she
would not be able to find flowers to adorn the chapel. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>This sad thought weighed heavily on her till one day, when sitting
weaving a rose-wreath for the child Jesus, a voice said in her ear,
&ldquo;Be not faint-hearted: are not the summer&rsquo;s blessings still
present with thee? let the present be sufficient for thee:&rdquo; and
so the girl wove on with lightened heart.</p>
<p>When winter came and the roses faded, the young girl was lying on
her death-bed; her only sorrow was leaving the Virgin and child Jesus
so lonely in the forest.</p>
<p>Lo! at her death the hedges once more bloomed; and, in spite of snow
and frost, fresh roses blossomed in the forest. With these was the pall
decked, and on the gentle wings of their fragrance the spirit of the
young girl was wafted to the sky.</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>A funny story is told of an old lady at Winterich (which we are now
passing). The old lady had been the superior of a convent which was
suppressed by the French. Much grieved at this, the old lady was seized
with fits of melancholy, and when in these fits was in the habit of
knocking her head against the table. These knocks being often repeated,
and with considerable force, the part thus ill used became hard and
horny, until at length a regular ram&rsquo;s horn, with three branches,
protruded from the much-knocked head. The old lady cut them down; but
they only grew larger and harder, entirely covering one of her eyes.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=

dame, who, although now eighty-eight years old, got well through the
operation, and lived for two years after, dying in 1836.</p>
<p>The hill called Brauneberg is now passed; the vineyards on it
produce a fine wine, called by its name.</p>
<p>At Muhlheim we must leave our river for a time, and explore the
charming valley of Veldenz, with its ruined castle placed on the summit
of a richly-wooded hill. The walk there is through miles of vineyards
edged with fruit-trees, and the valley below the castle is emerald with
well-watered grass.</p>
<p>The hills are a mass of forest, and the variously-shaped houses,
which are dropped at uncertain intervals along the bubbling stream,
form a pleasant picture of rural beauty.</p>
<p>Veldenz was a little principality in itself; formerly it was
governed by the Counts of the same name, but afterwards it was given to
the church of Verdun, and was then governed by fourteen magistrates,
elected by the different villages, and presided over by a
pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t, probably appointed by the Bishop of Verdun.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Irmina wept for her knightly lover, who had departed
to fight the Saracens. Her mother bade her dry her tears, for there was
no lack of lovers for a pretty girl like her; but Irmina replied with
sobs, that the ring which her knight had given her, and which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>she always wore, united her to him for ever, and
seemed to whisper words of love and caress her hand.</p>
<p>Then the mother, fearing for her daughter&rsquo;s health, advised
her to throw off the ring, for her lover was surely dead, and it would
be wiser to take a live husband than mope for a dead lover.</p>
<p>Persuaded at length, Irmina cast her ring into the well, and seemed
to get the better of her melancholy; but one day the ring was drawn up
in the well-bucket, and the maid brought it in to her young mistress:
then her love likewise returned.</p>
<p>Her mother again persuaded her to cast away the fatal ring, and this
time it was buried deep in the earth; but a bean that was buried there
likewise, grew rapidly up, and carried the ring to the window of
Irmina&rsquo;s chamber.</p>
<p>Much frightened, Irmina yet rejoiced at recovering her ring, and her
love for the absent knight grew stronger than ever. Her mother once
more pressed her to destroy it, and this time proposed fire as a means
of being quit of the ring for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not, dear mother,&rdquo; said the maiden;
&ldquo;&rsquo;twould be sin before God. In spirit I am wedded to my
absent knight, and, alive or dead, none other husband will I
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the mother persisted, and wrested the ring from her
daughter&rsquo;s hand; but before she could cast it into the flames the
knight stood alive in the room, and soon the ring was used for the
purpose of turning the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href=

Irmina into a happy bridegroom and bride.</p>

<p>A day&rsquo;s exploration of the Veldenz-thal, and other valleys
into which it leads, makes us acquainted with many agreeable walks and
charming scenes. The old castle itself is quite a ruin, but well worth
exploring, there being still a good deal of its stone-work remaining;
vineyards are found within and around its walls.</p>
<p>What enjoyment there is in finding one&rsquo;s self free to climb
and saunter amidst delicious scenery! Now we walk briskly along,
returning the &ldquo;<i lang="de">Guten tag</i>&rdquo; of the
ever-polite peasants, who enunciate this phrase from the bottom of
their throats. The <i lang="de">guten</i> is not heard at all, and the
<i lang="de">tag</i> sounds as if, in the endeavour to swallow the
word, the performer choked, and was obliged, when half-strangled, to
gasp it out.</p>
<p>At midday we halt, and luxuriate over our hard-boiled eggs and bread
and cheese, with green cloth ready spread, and gushing stream sparkling
from the rock. Then, as we lie back musing and dreaming, what strange
thoughts of the old times come into our heads! Peopled by fancy, the
old towers and walls again re-echo to the lutes and voices of long-gone
days.</p>
<p>And what a charming friend or mistress we find in Fancy! Most
beautiful of a&euml;rial beings, she gilds for us the darkest paths,

fell in love, one after another, as each came to years of indiscretion.
The eldest, being forbidden to marry by her father, died in three
months; the second, being also forbidden, was obliged to be confined in
a mad-house; still the unrelenting old father treated his third and
youngest daughter in the same harsh manner, objecting to her very
natural wish to marry a brave young esquire: having more spirit than
her sisters, or being warned by their fate, this youngest ran away with
her sweetheart, and was disinherited by the old curmudgeon, who seems
to have loved nothing but his gold. We are not told the after-fate of
the youngest, or whether love made up for loss of gold.</p>

</div>
<p>Berncastel is a delightful, old, tumble-down-looking conglomeration
of queer-shaped houses; a mountain-stream hurries through its principal
street, if such a heterogeneous jumble of odd gable-ends and door-posts
may be called a street: but as it does duty for one, it must receive
the appellation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145"
name="pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>This street should rather be spoken of in the past tense, for the
greater part of it was burnt in 1857; three times the town was on fire
in this year, a church and about forty houses being consumed in the
last and largest conflagration. As we shall have to revert to these
fires again, suffice it to say that the part of the old street nearest
the mountain was destroyed.</p>
<p>Berncastel contains some four thousand inhabitants; the tourist
passing in a steam-boat would hardly believe so many people were housed
in so small a space. This remark will apply to most of the towns and
villages on the Moselle, for only a few of the better class of houses
are visible from the water in general, the mass of buildings being
huddled out of observation as much as possible, and crowded under the
base of the impending hills; formerly these Burgs were all walled,
which accounts for the crushing.</p>
<p>This town dates from the tenth century, and at the end of the
thirteenth it was destroyed by a fire, in which the ch&acirc;teau of
the Bishop was burnt, together with many pictures and other valuable
objects, to the estimated worth of 70,000 rix thalers; it is now
inhabited by many rich people, to whom a great part of the fine
vineyards of the vicinity belong: there are also mines of gold, silver,
copper, and lead, which serve to enrich the community.</p>
<p>The vineyards are very extensive, and produce a very good wine; they
cover the mountain to a height of some hundreds of feet, and extend for
miles down the river. We are shown the estimation in which the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=

<h3 class="main">THE BEST DOCTOR.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The lord of the ch&acirc;teau of Berncastel sat with
his Chaplain drinking his wine,&mdash;not sipping it, but pouring down
huge bumpers, as was the custom then.</p>
<p>Seeing his Chaplain did not drink, the Baron pressed him to do so,
assuring him that the fine Muscatel-Berncasteler would be good for his
health.</p>
<p>The Chaplain sighing, refused, saying, &ldquo;It was not meet that
he should be drinking while his Bishop lay sick in the town at their
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sayest thou so!&rdquo; cried the Baron; &ldquo;I know a
doctor will cure him;&rdquo; and quaffing down another mighty flagon he
set off to the Bishop, carrying a cask of the precious wine upon his
own shoulders.</p>
<p>Arrived at the palace, he induced the invalid Bishop to consult the
doctor he had brought with him: the invalid tasted, and sipped, then,
finding the liquor was good, he took a vast gulp, and soon a fresh life
seemed glowing within him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wine restores me,&rdquo; quoth the Bishop. &ldquo;In
truth, Sir Baron, thou saidst well; it is the best doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that time the Bishop&rsquo;s health mended, and returning again
and again to the great phial&mdash;for he was in nowise afraid of its
size&mdash;he soon was quite cured; and ever after he consulted this
doctor when feeling unwell, keeping him always within easy reach.</p>
<p>Since this wonderful cure many patients have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>imitated the example of the venerable Bishop,
and a single barrel of Berncasteler-Muscateler is considered sufficient
to cure an ordinary patient. More must, however, be taken by those who
require it; and in all cases it has been observed, that the patient so
loves his good doctor he never is willing to be separated from him for
long. &ldquo;Come and try the Doctor Wine, O ye who suffer under a
vicious system of sour beer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little openings in Berncastel, for we cannot call them squares,

and talk between.</p>

<p>A good view is got from the ruined castle over the town; which not
in itself very interesting, is yet, on this account, well worth a walk.
When there, Cus lies at our feet, with the river rolling between us and
it. This Cus (pronounced Koos) was the birthplace of the celebrated
Cardinal Cusanus, who, report says, was a fisherman&rsquo;s son: this
is, to say the least of it, very uncertain; but doubtless he was born
in quite a low station of life, and by his abilities raised himself to
be Bishop of Brixen in the Tyrol, and a Cardinal.</p>
<p>He died in 1464; his body rests at Rome, and his heart is deposited
in the church of the Hospital which he founded at Cus, for the
maintenance of thirty-three persons who were to be not less than fifty
years of age, and unmarried; or if married, their wives were to go into
a convent.</p>
<p>Of these thirty-three, six are ecclesiastics, six nobles, and
twenty-one bourgeois; they all dine at a common table, and wear a like
habit of grey; they are presided over by a Rector, who is to be always
a priest of irreproachable manners, a mild and good man, and not less
than forty years old: all the inmates take a vow of chastity and
obedience to the orders of their superiors.</p>
<p>The Inn in Berncastel is a fair sample of the houses of refreshment
on the Moselle: the landlord dines with his guests; the dinner is good,
but ill-served, and is eaten at one o&rsquo;clock, being followed by
supper at eight. Travellers come and go without the people of the house
seeming to care whether they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>stop long time or short; they are
charged according to their nation, English paying more than French, and
Germans less than either: however, the charges are not at all high,
except for private dinners and out-of-the-way things.</p>
<p>The original pie-dish bason is here found in full force, accompanied
by small square boards of napkins; the scantiness, combined with the
hardness of which, render them about as useful as a wooden platter
would be for the purpose of drying your face,&mdash;which, owing to the
fortunate construction of the bason, does not, luckily, become very
wet.</p>
<p>An agreeable fellow-diner informed us, that on the Moselle two codes
of law were in force,&mdash;the Prussian on the right bank, and the
Code Napol&eacute;on on the left: thus, in Berncastel a couple could
not be united in marriage without a church ceremony, while in Cus it
was optional. Our informant added that the ladies generally insisted on
a church marriage, not because they thought the ceremony necessary, but
to show off the grand array of their wedding-finery.</p>
<p>A tale is told at Cus of a Ghost who haunts the neighbourhood, and
sometimes visits the town; he is called</p>

<h3 class="main">THE BAD MAURUS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The departed Maurus, who now figures as a pernicious
hobgoblin, was formerly a resident of Cus; a drunkard and scoffer at
all things holy, this wretch filled up the measure of his iniquities by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>beating his wife: so ill did he use her, that
the neighbours were constantly obliged to come in and save her from his
brutality.</p>
<p>The thread of his evil life was summarily cut in this manner: one
night as he returned, drunk as usual, to his home, fully intending to
beat his wife if waiting up, and equally bent on thrashing her if she
had gone to bed, a man in black with a lantern kindly offered to show
him the way home: he eagerly accepted the offer, and his guide preceded
him; so the two went on, the black-hearted man led by the man in
black.</p>
<p>In the morning Maurus was found lying dead at the foot of a rock;
they raised the body and brought it to his poor wife, who, forgetting
all his ill-usage, sorrowed for the death of her husband.</p>
<p>The widow ordered a suitable funeral, and the body was laid in the
churchyard, but on coming back from the funeral, Maurus was seen
looking from the garret-window, where he had been observing and
sneering at his own funeral: everybody was horrified, and Maurus
continued to haunt the upper story of his wife&rsquo;s house until
three priests exorcised the hobgoblin, and forced him into the
country.</p>
<p>Here the mischievous rascal amused himself by shouting to the
ferrymen, &ldquo;Fetch over! Fetch over!&rdquo; They, thinking it the
voice of a voyager, willingly crossed; then Maurus jeered them,
clapping his hands: at last the priests attacked him again, and drove
him into the forest. Still, at times the wicked Maurus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>sneaks into town, and sits on the doorstep of
his old house, and his voice is yet heard in the forest, where he
wanders for ever.</p>

<p>A charming mountain walk of about four miles leads to Trarbach. Up
through the vines we climb, no longer wondering where all the wine
comes from; above the vines is a bare crest of heath-covered turf, then
a steep descent leads into the valley, at the mouth of which Trarbach
is placed: but by going this road, beautiful as it is, more interesting
scenery is omitted. The distance by river from Berncastel to Trarbach
is about fifteen miles, while by land it is only, as we have said,
about four, so great are the bendings of the stream; which, however, we
shall follow, being by no means tired of her society. It was at

<p>Early rising is absolutely indispensable to the tourist on the
Moselle. The steamers constantly start at five or six in the morning,
and if walking, the midday heat is too great to be encountered; added
to which, he would lose his pleasant rest-time by the sparkling
stream.</p>
<p>From Berncastel, then, in the grey of early morning, we wander
forth. There are roads on both banks,<span class="pagenum">[<a id=

by-roads, through gardens and vineyards. As we proceed, and begin to
think that coffee and new-laid eggs would be no encumbrance, but rather
help to balance the system, a faint tinge of crimson appears over the
grey hills; little wreaths of mist break away from the mass of watery
vapour that clings to the river&rsquo;s banks, and curl upwards to the
light, and then with all its glory comes the</p>

peasants are ascending to their labour amid the vines; suddenly a
strain of martial music fills the air, and all look towards the trees

voices take up the strain, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href=

<p class="first">Where we come to patches of grain-land we find the
ploughman busy with his oxen turning up the fresh earth. The oxen are
coupled together by short beams of wood, which are fastened to their
heads, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>and must keep the poor animals in a constant
state of misery; in other respects the cattle seem well cared for.</p>
<p>Occasionally we meet droves of sheep tended by boys and dogs. The
sheep crop a precarious livelihood from the bits of waste land near the
river and on the slopes of hills, whose aspect is unfavourable to the
culture of the vine.</p>
<p>Arriving at Zeltingen, on the right bank, we taste one of the most
delicious wines on the Moselle; it is of a fine rich colour, with a
highly-scented flavour, but is withal light and sparkling. In the
following incident it will be seen that this wine was properly
appreciated by the prebends who owned the Martinshof farm in former
days.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE CASK IN RESERVE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The fame of the wine made from the grapes that grew in
the Martinshof vineyard penetrated even to Tr&egrave;ves, and the
Elector Philip was very desirous to drink of a wine so renowned; but
the monks, who owned the vineyard, would not take heed of the hints
dropped by the Elector on this subject, as they did not love his
tyrannical government.</p>
<p>The Elector, therefore, determined, under the pretext of an official
inspection, to visit the Cloister.</p>
<p>He accordingly arrived, and the prebends, who had been summoned to
meet him, did not fail to make their appearance. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Abbot perceived that the inspection concerned more his cellar
than his cloister. He kept his own counsel, and ordered different sorts
of Rhine, Moselle, and Nahe wine to be set before the guests, murmuring
the while to himself, &ldquo;Drink on&mdash;drink away, my noble
Elector and guests; but the Martinshof wine remains, bright in the
cellar: of the mother cask shalt thou never taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Elector was about to leave he called the Abbot aside, and
praised highly the wine he had drunk, and thanked him for his
hospitality; he also invited the Abbot to Tr&egrave;ves, but told him
he feared he could not give him as good wine as his own
Martinshofberger.</p>
<p>The Abbot smiled, thanked him for the compliment, and added, that
when the Elector should come to see his <i>cloister</i>, not his
<i>cellar</i>, he would serve to him the <i>real</i> Martinshof wine;
till then it would be saved for his <i>true</i> friends.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The prebendaries and monks were so fond of good wine, that the
people suppose their saints must also have a liking for grape-juice;
therefore, as soon as the new wine is made each year, a bottle is
placed in the hands of the effigy of the Patron Saint, or offered at
his shrine: who drinks it eventually, does not appear.</p>
<p>We seem to be quite out of the world on the banks of the Moselle. We
wander along amid its ever-varying scenery with that delight which
novelty always gives. At every turn new views break upon <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>us;
at every step something calls our attention; now it is a flower, then a
rock, and again a castle, a group of old houses or trees, or perhaps a
little gay boat adorned with boughs of trees, in which children,
celebrating a holiday, are singing: so we wander on, and find at midday
that, owing to the many detentions caused by these things, and the
frequent sketches the beauty of the localities have compelled us to
make, we have progressed but little on our road. But what does it
matter? we cannot be in a paradise too long; and at every few miles we
are sure of finding a little village inn, with a clean room in which we
may eat or sleep.</p>
<p>Cloister-Machern is on the left bank of our river, a little further
down the stream than Zeltingen. This cloister once contained a lovely
nun, named</p>

<h3 class="main">ERMESINDE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Antioch had fallen before the Crusaders&rsquo; arms,
and the Cross waved from her towers. The joyful tidings were brought to
the banks of the Moselle, and bonfires celebrated the event. The
pilgrim who had brought this news from over sea was feasted by
Ermesinde&rsquo;s father, and all gathered round him, eagerly catching
his words.</p>
<p>He told of the deeds of valour performed by the Christian Knights;
and as Ermesinde greedily listened, but feared to question the pilgrim,
he mentioned the name of her lover, and highly extolled him, mournfully
adding, &ldquo;Such valour as this Knight showed forth was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>surpassed by none, but now the grave is closed
over his glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing, poor Ermesinde fell as though dead, and lay motionless on
the stone floor; then the pilgrim saw by the looks of those present
that he had incautiously broken her heart. Further interrogating the
pilgrim, Ermesinde&rsquo;s father only gained a repetition of the first
story told him, and other particulars seemed to confirm it.</p>
<p>The walls of Cloister-Machern received the poor broken reed, who
offered to heaven a heart that was dead to the world.</p>
<p>Soon poor Ermesinde found that stone walls do not shut out
wickedness, nor sombre dresses cover only morality; for in
Cloister-Machern the nuns, one and all, led scandalous lives, and
mocked her for not joining with them. She resisted their wiles, and
sought refuge in prayer.</p>
<p>One evening a pilgrim arrived at the gate, and asked Ermesinde, who
answered the bell, to give him refreshment. As a strain of music, once
familiar and dear, the sounds smote on the nun&rsquo;s ear, and with a
bewildered look she gazed on the pilgrim&rsquo;s face; the light fell
on her pale features, and the pilgrim exclaimed,
&ldquo;Ermesinde!&rdquo; One long look into each other&rsquo;s eyes and
time had vanished, care was forgotten, intervening years had rolled
away, and Ermesinde and Rupert were in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Bound by her vows, Ermesinde would not consent to accompany her
lover in flight, but she agreed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>see him at intervals; and
while her sister nuns rioted in the hall she sometimes knelt with
Rupert in the chapel, where they prayed for each other&rsquo;s
happiness.</p>
<p>When waiting one night for her lover, an old beggar drew near, and
prayed for some food. Ermesinde went in to fetch some, but the others
refused her request that the old beggar should be relieved, and coming
out to him, they drove him away with threats and abuse.</p>
<p>Then the old beggar turned round, and raising his hand to the
heavens, cried out: &ldquo;Woe be unto you, ye false servants of God!
chastisement will soon overtake you.&rdquo; So saying, he vanished into
the dark cloudy night.</p>
<p>Rupert and Ermesinde were kneeling within the chapel when the storm
which was threatening burst forth; fire struck from the clouds on the
cloister, destroying the nuns in the hall; the chapel alone was
preserved.</p>
<p>Ermesinde now was persuaded that she was released from her vows, and
soon she pledged them to Rupert, and as his loved wife she worshipped
her God and performed all her duties far better than those who
uselessly shut themselves up from the world.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>A curious old robbers&rsquo; nest is still to be seen in the
Michaelslei, which is a tall red cliff, a mile or two further on. It
consists of a cave, with a strong wall built over its mouth. No path
used to lead there, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href=
"#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>long ladders were used by the
robbers, who, drawing them up after them, were in perfect security.</p>
<p>This castellated cave was once used as a prison, in which an
Archbishop was placed; this was the good Bishop Kuno, who was on his
road to Tr&egrave;ves, where he was to be installed as Archbishop.</p>
<p>The <span class="corr" id="xd21e3622" title=
"Source: Prebends">prebends</span> of Tr&egrave;ves wished not to have
Kuno for their Archbishop. They, therefore, excited Count Theodorich,
who was governor of their town, to send out armed men and capture the
Bishop.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when halting at Kylburg, the Bishop, who was travelling
in company with the Bishop of Spires, was seized and carried off to the
Michaelslei fortress, and there thrown into a dungeon.</p>
<p>Many days the good Bishop languished in his damp cell. At length
four ruffians entered and carried him forth to the top of the rock;
there binding his limbs, they addressed him as follows: &ldquo;We have
brought you here to see whether you are, indeed, elected of God; as if
so, no harm will <span class="corr" id="xd21e3629" title=
"Source: befal">befall</span> you.&rdquo; Thus jeering, they threw him
down into the valley; but the Bishop sustaining no hurt, they twice
repeated their deed.</p>
<p>Finding he was not thus to be slain, they ended by killing him with
their swords, and cut off his head.</p>
<p>The good Bishop was laid in a tomb, and many miracles were there
performed. These coming to the ears of the Count Theodorich, his
conscience smote him, and he took the cross and proceeded to the Holy
Land. The vessel, unable to uphold his guilty weight, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>sank
down, and the waters now shroud the remains of this wicked Count.</p>
<p>Rounding the promontory on which the Wolf&rsquo;s Cloister is buried
in trees, our river&rsquo;s course turns for awhile in the direction of
its source, so much does it wind. The Wolf Cloister is only a ruin, of
which but little remains.</p>
<p>At a small chapel near here the Pastor of Traben used to perform a
service on each Tuesday after Pentecost, and here gathered crowds from
all parts to attend at the ceremony. All were covered with flowers, and
the young of both sexes pelted each other with bouquets, and dancing
and merriment occupied all. But now, says the narrator (Storck), the
convent and the sanctuary are no more; their place is filled with
vineyards. The present age respects nothing but gold; popular
f&ecirc;tes, sanctuaries, souvenirs of antiquity, and rustic
simplicity, are alike swallowed up, and all is sacrificed for
money.</p>
<p>A wonderful story is told of a young lady of these parts. One fine
day in summer, a very beautiful girl of the family of Meesen was
sitting at her open window, engaged in knitting. She was so occupied
with her work or her thoughts, that she did not perceive the fearful
storm that was rising over the mountains, until suddenly there came a
clap of thunder that shook the whole house. Arising in haste, the
&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd21e3644" title=
"Source: fraulein">fr&auml;ulein</span>&rdquo; endeavoured to shut to
the window; but before she could accomplish her object a thunderbolt
fell, and striking the metal-work which adorned the laces that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>fastened her bodice, it passed through her
garments, softening the metal clasps of her garters, and partially
melting her shoe-buckles; then, without having harmed the fair
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3649" title=
"Source: fraulein">fr&auml;ulein</span>, it burst its way out by the
floor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3652src" href="#xd21e3652" name=

<p>Very high hills are surrounding us as we approach Trarbach, a
beautifully wooded slope, and rich cliffs announce a site of more than
ordinary beauty; but before we take our evening&rsquo;s rest in
Trarbach we must, landing at Riesbach, climb to the top of Mount
Royal.</p>
<p>This fortress was made by Vauban for Louis XIV. It cost an immense
sum of money, and people from all parts were collected and forced to
work at its ramparts; but sixteen years after its completion it was
dismantled in compliance with treaties, and only a few mounds and walls
now mark the site.</p>
<p>Splendid views are seen from it on all sides. The river, starting
from our feet, appears gliding in all directions; and the evening
shadows are filling the valleys and climbing the hills, while the glory
of the departing sun hangs yet upon the corn-fields.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Trarbach.</p>
</div>
<p>Trarbach was an interesting little town, of perhaps fifteen hundred
inhabitants. It was one of the most perfect specimens of its class
existing, and the fire that burnt it to the ground has robbed many a
tourist of subjects for his sketch-book that can scarcely be
replaced.</p>
<p>The streets of the town were very narrow and winding, the houses
projected over their bases in every variety of irregularity: they were
nearly all built of wood frames, filled up with plaster, as those in
the villages are; but frequently this plaster was covered with
many-coloured tiles, rounded at the edges. The general effect was a
sort of green shot with red tints, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166"
href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>and being glazed, these tiles
reflected blue from the sky, and broken lights and hues of all sorts,
giving a very gay and pleasing appearance. The casements were filled
with glass that was nearly as green as the tiles, and from the windows
hung out lengths of cloth; or bright flowers in their pots filled the
openings, when not occupied by the faces of gossips, who carried on
quick conversation with others below in the street, or else in the
opposite windows, almost within reach of their arms.</p>
<p>A little canal wound about, following the course of the streets.
This was covered over with flat stones; but many apertures allowed your
feet to slip in, if a careful watch was not kept. The pavements
required the same caution, as holes were abundant, and cabbage-stalks
plentiful.</p>
<p>Here and there houses more modern, or of greater pretension than
others, had large windows and walls built of stone. The church was
placed on an eminence, and had many gables, quite in keeping with the
little walled town over which it presided. Squeezed into a space too
small for its wants, the town overlapped the old walls and formed
different suburbs, the chief of which lay on the banks of a brook which
here dashes down through the steep valley into the river.</p>
<p>Busy and flourishing, Trarbach was quite a gay city compared to the
clusters of houses that call themselves Stadts and Dorfs on the banks
of our river, and in the valleys surrounding.</p>
<p>High up on a lofty cliff directly over the town are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>the
ruins of the Gr&auml;finburg Castle. In bygone days this castle
belonged to the powerful Counts of Sponheim, and was built with funds
procured in the following manner from an Archbishop of Tr&egrave;ves,
and named after the sharp-witted Countess.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE BISHOP&rsquo;S RANSOM.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Count of Sponheim dying, his beautiful wife,
Lauretta, was left with her young son to contend against the malice of
the Archbishop Baldwin of Tr&egrave;ves, who claimed her territory for
himself, with no right but that of &ldquo;the strong hand;&rdquo;
Baldwin deeming that a young widow would not be able to support the
claims of her son against an Elector and Prince-Bishop.</p>
<p>The Archbishop formally excommunicated her as a first step, on her
contumaciously refusing to surrender her rights to a usurper. The
beautiful Countess laughed at this proceeding, and being assisted by
many good knights, defied all his efforts.</p>
<p>One fine day in May, the Bishop, who was lodging in Trarbach,
embarked in a boat for Coblence, and much enjoying the voyage, stood
talking and planning with his adherents how best he might surprise the
Countess of Sponheim, whose castle of Starkenburg rose from the rocks
overhead.</p>
<p>While thus scheming, the Bishop perceived on the bank a number of
men, who seemed armed, and awaiting his coming. Hastily, therefore, his
lordship gave orders to quicken their pace; but suddenly a great
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>shock threw Baldwin and many of his friends down
on their knees. This was caused by the bow of the boat coming quickly
against a strong chain, which was placed by the Countess&rsquo;s orders
just under the water, reaching from shore to shore. Before the Bishop
and friends could recover their footing the Countess&rsquo;s adherents
were on them, and the whole party made prisoners and marched up to the
Castle of Starkenburg.</p>
<p>The angry Bishop was led into the presence of the beautiful lady. At
first the Prelate demanded that he should instantly be freed, and spoke
of the rights of the Church, the shameless treachery of the whole
proceeding, and the risk his captors ran of damnation.</p>
<p>At all this the lady but smiled, and the Bishop&rsquo;s heart melted
within him as he gazed on her beauty.</p>
<p>The days sped away, and the Archbishop Baldwin finding the beautiful
Countess was not to be moved by his threats, nor yet won by his love,
bethought him at length of his people, who pined for so gentle a
shepherd; therefore he sent off to Tr&egrave;ves, asking his flock for
a ransom, which the Countess insisted his lordship should pay before he
set out, &ldquo;as some slight compensation,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;for the loss of his presence. Moreover,&rdquo; her ladyship
added, &ldquo;that the Archbishop was something indebted for the use of
her larder and cellar.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The bill for eating and drinking proved heavy, and the amount for
the loss of his pleasing society brought the sum total up to sufficient
to pay for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>building the strong castle, whose ruins now
crumble over the good town of Trarbach: this castle proved an effectual
barrier against the Archbishop&rsquo;s encroachments.</p>
<p>At parting, the Prelate absolved the fair Countess of guilt, and
took away the excommunication under which she had laboured; so there is
probably no truth in the tale that her ladyship haunts the old ruin,
and constantly weeps for her crime of incarcerating so holy a man.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This castle of Gr&auml;finburg was a most important fortress, and
capable of making a stout resistance, even in the days of cannon; for,
in 1734, the Marquis of Belle-Isle was sent by Louis XIV., with a
strong army, to ravage the territories of the Elector of Tr&egrave;ves,
who escaped by flight to Ehrenbreitstein. The Marquis laid siege to
Trarbach, and after a hard struggle, and enduring a fierce bombardment,
the garrison capitulated, and marched out with all the honours of war:
the castle was then rased to the ground by the Marquis, leaving only
the portion engraved at the head of the preceding chapter.</p>
<p>The burning of Trarbach, which happened last autumn, was a splendid
but melancholy sight; we chanced to be sleeping at Traben, a town on
the opposite side of the river, and from our windows we saw the
magnificent spectacle.</p>
<p>About four in the afternoon the fire first began, caused (it was
said) by some children playing with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>matches. As may be
easily imagined, from the fact of the very old houses, all built of
wood, being crushed into narrow streets and enclosed within walls, the
flames spread rapidly; so fast, indeed, they came on, that the poor
people flying were forced to throw down the goods they were trying to
save and run for their lives. The church, being on an eminence a little
out of the town, was thought quite secure, and in it were stored the
effects from the neighbouring houses until it was filled from roof-tree
to floor.</p>
<p>The night now set in dark as pitch; still the fire crept on,
reaching its red forked tongue over the narrow streets, in spite of the
water which was freely supplied from the river; at last the church
caught, and the flames, bursting from windows and roof, consumed all
the goods that were stored, and destroyed the old building itself.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3804width" id="p170"><img src="images/p170.jpg"

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sight was superb; the whole space, enclosed by the hills in
which the town lay, surged in great waves of fire: in this huge molten
sea great monsters appeared to be moving, whose shapes seemed writhing
with pain as those of the devils in hell.</p>
<p>The glare fell on the ruins of Gr&auml;finburg, and the water
reflected it back. The houses were all burnt to the ground, excepting
only those seen in the view, and a very few others which lay in the
outskirt. The inhabitants laboured all night with the engines, but at
six in the morning, when we came away, great clouds of dull smoke still
ascended from where Trarbach had stood, but which now was only a
ruin.</p>
<p>This fire was one of a series. In three succeeding days, Zell,
Zeltingen, and Trarbach were more or less burnt; and within a short
time Berncastel was thrice visited by the Fire-fiend. Many other
smaller fires also took place, and no one could give us the reason;
troops were sent out from Tr&egrave;ves, but nothing was ever
elicited.</p>
<p>Traben, which was also partially burnt, is a curious enough place,
and has as bad pavement as any in Europe: the little inn there was well
spoken of by Murray, so now they charge very dear, and give very
indifferent food. When we speak of dearness on the Moselle, we do not
mean actually dear, for prices are far lower than those on the Rhine;
only when in one little inn we get our supper and bed, with bottle of
wine, for three shillings, we grumble at paying five for the same in
another, where nothing is better. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172"
href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not far from Traben is the place where Kloster Springiersbach
formerly stood in a solitude; here came crowds of pilgrims, for the
place was most holy, and inhabited by many pious monks: of one of these
a legend is told, called</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A very pious monk lay dying upon his bed, around him
his brethren prayed for his soul; the dying man suffered from much
pain, therefore his dissolution would be a blessing for him. The monk
had been too weak to attend at his prayers in the chapel for many days
past, and lo! over the place where he had been accustomed to pray, a
white lily put forth its leaves. The holy man died, and the lily then
burst into flower: so passed the guileless soul of the man from earth
into heaven, and the pure blooming lily long marked the place where he
knelt in the chapel,&mdash;an image of him whose departure from earth
we now have narrated.</p>

<p>Still surrounded by very high hills, the course of our river winds
onwards past Starkenburg, from which the Countess pounced down on the
crafty Archbishop. The pathway to Enkirch extends, under fruit-trees, a
little way inland, to where the ferry-boat crosses the river.</p>
<p>Passing from Bertrich to Traben one day, we heard, on arriving near
Enkirch, sounds of music and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>lowing of cattle. People in
shoals, too, were crossing the river, filling the boats of all sizes.
We found it was Fair-day in Enkirch, so, joining a party of
brightly-dressed girls, we went over to see all &ldquo;the fun of the
<i>Fair</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these Kermes, or Fairs, the amusements are much like those on
similar festivals in England. Goods of all sorts are exposed in little
old booths, round which the gossiping purchasers stand. Ribbons and
gingerbread, shawls, pottery, and cheap dresses, are the principal
objects of purchase; also spikes for the back of the hair of unmarried
girls, and little embroidered pieces of velvet or cloth.</p>
<p>The amusements consist chiefly in dancing and drinking; there are
not many shows, but &ldquo;the round-about&rdquo; plays its full part,
and even women and men ride, as well as the children.</p>
<p>The dancing is carried on with the greatest possible spirit; in
fact, it seems a matter of duty. The &ldquo;Schottische,&rdquo; or
something very much like it, seems to be the favourite dance; but
waltzing in the old style has many adherents.</p>
<p>The girls are smartly dressed, and very lively and pleasant; they
and their lovers drink freely of the light wine of the country, and
grow a little more lively as the day turns into night.</p>
<p>Strangers at these places are considered as part of the show, and
stared at amazingly; but when addressed, the peasants are perfectly
civil, and seem glad to talk: they are, for the most part, well
informed,&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175"
name="pb175">175</a>]</span>far more so than farm-labourers in England
usually are.</p>
<p>When the Kermes is over, the holiday-makers in groups embark in
their boats, or walk merrily home, often singing in parts as they go.
Some of the men take rather more wine than is good for them, but a
quarrel very seldom occurs.</p>

<p>Enkirch is a small town of 2000 inhabitants, containing nothing
remarkable. A great deal of wine is made near there, and its situation
is very agreeable; surrounded as it is by hills, the summer showers
often break over it, cooling the air, and freshening the sail.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE VALLEY OF HUSBANDS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the heights over the little hamlet of Burg are
still to be seen some remnants of an old castle. Here a Robber-Knight
once had his residence. This Knight made it his profession to capture
all travellers, and carry them off to his dungeon, from which they were
only released on procuring a very large ransom.</p>
<p>For a long time this trade was most prosperously carried on, but at
length (success perhaps begetting envy, as usual,) a certain nobleman
vowed vengeance on the depredator, and swore to destroy him and his
castle. For this purpose he set out with a large force, and surrounded
the Robber-Knight&rsquo;s tower.</p>
<p>The robbers fought furiously, yet were forced to retreat into their
fort by the superior force of the nobleman.</p>
<p>The chief then being short of provisions, consulted his wife (as all
prudent men should), and she concocted a plan. The lady then mounted
the tower, and addressing the nobleman, said that the stronghold should
be given up if he would allow her to carry out a bundle of whatever she
wished. To this modest request the besieger readily gave his assent,
and the lady came forth with a heavy bundle placed in a basket, which
she carried with difficulty.</p>
<p>The besiegers allowed her to pass, and rushed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>into
the fort, slaying the robbers who there were collected.</p>
<p>The lady and bundle were all that escaped; and so this courageous
and sharp-witted woman saved the life of her husband.</p>
<p>The valley is still called the Manne-thal, or Valley of
Husbands.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Below Burg, on the left bank, is Reil, most charmingly snuggled in
trees; a road from it leads up to the forest, through which passes a
good road to Alf. This road keeps along the crest of the hill, past the
neck of the Marienburg promontory, then descends into Alf.</p>
<p>The views from this road are superb. Through the openings of
oak-trees are seen distant landscapes, that, sleeping in sunshine, seem
gems to adorn the green girdle which Nature binds round the earth.</p>
<p>The fairy Moselle seems tranquilly sleeping through noontide, while
in the heavens the fleecy white clouds are protecting our gentle river
from harm; and their brightness reflected in her, seems a sweet dream
sent from above, which gladdens the heart of the sleeper.</p>
<p>There is a dip in the long neck of land that leads towards Zell,
which enables us to see a distant reach of our river; thus, standing
quite still, three different windings are seen, and by taking a very
few paces, a fourth (beyond Alf) comes in view. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>Comparisons are more or less odious, as every one knows, and has
written when young; but, considering the raptures in which people
annually indulge on the Rhine, it is, to say the least of it, wonderful
that scarcely any visit our lovely river, which certainly will not
suffer by being compared with the grander and manlier stream.</p>
<p>The Convent of Marienburg dates from the twelfth century. Owing to
its situation, it was always sought by conflicting parties as a strong
post in war-time, which so interfered with its usefulness as a place of
repose for the weary in mind, that Pope Leo X. had it abolished, and
the twelve canonesses received each a pension of twenty-five florins of
gold, a half tun of wine, and three sacks of corn; so with these goods
of the world they contented themselves for the loss of their
convent.</p>
<p>At this present time the ruins of the convent and church are still
standing, and within them an inn and a bright little garden, where
refreshments are served by the landlady and her two daughters: the
father is one of the Foresters, and his house is adorned with arms of
all sorts. In the garden is a large room, surrounded with spoils of the
chase, and stuffed animals of all sorts and sizes. The young ladies
play the guitar and sing national songs, so a day may be pleasantly
spent there in the old German style.</p>
<p>There is a little chapel still fitted up; as they open the door the
interior is gloomily seen, but a window <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>throws a strong light
on a misshapen image of some cadaverous saint. The effect is quite
startling, especially if you have been listening to the tales of the
hermits and ghosts who delighted to live and to wander here. Here is
one of the stories, called</p>

<h3 class="main">THE PALE NUN.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Over-persuaded by the Abbess and sisters, Marie had
entered the convent, forsaking her lover, the Knight Carl of Zant, and
all her worldly possessions.</p>
<p>The vows were taken and the days wore on, the kind attentions and
former solicitude of the nuns vanished, and poor Marie found her life
one long monotony; then she remembered her lover, and the wings of the
poor prisoned bird were hurt by the wires of the cage.</p>
<p>At length she bethought her that her possessions, not herself, were
the objects desired by the Abbess; so she fell at the feet of this
lady, and offered to give all that she had to the convent, if only she
might depart. The haughty Superior severely replied, that her goods had
all passed to the cloister, and inflicted a penance for the carnal
desires that she said were wickedly filling the heart of the nun.</p>
<p>From this time forth Marie rapidly drooped like a poor blighted
flower, whose beauty and gladness departed, remains on its stem with
bowed head and but a semblance of life.</p>
<p>One morning a fisherman found her dead body at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>rest
within the Moselle. The Knight Carl being informed of her fate set off
for the Holy Land, and there died fighting the battles of faith.</p>
<p>The Pale Nun may often be seen, with her wan face lit up by the
moon, as she glides noiselessly through forest and ruin.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The ruins are placed on the summit of the neck of land, and
Murray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guide-book&rdquo; compares the view at this place
to one on the Wye, and with justice; indeed, those who are acquainted
with the beautiful Wye will find the Moselle has many points of
resemblance to her young sister in England, but she is in every respect
more lovely and graceful.</p>
<p>This promontory is about three miles in length, and scarcely five
hundred yards across in the narrowest place. It is a spur of the Eifel
mountains, or hills, as they are called, according to the fancy of the
speaker. The promontory is two or three hundred feet over the bed of
the river, and near the ruined cloister the slope is almost
precipitous, just affording spaces for vines, which flourish extremely
on the south side. The forest extends over the base of the promontory,
and then gives place to the corn-fields and meadows.</p>
<p>The Eifel is a volcanic range, which is thrown up in peaks and great
rugged masses. Formerly, these were volcanoes or craters, but now they
are merely objects of interest in the landscape, shining above the
level of the forest, which climbs round their bases. This level varies
in height, but is always some hundreds <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>of feet above the
river; and from the table-land break little valleys, completely
embosomed in trees, and glittering with brooks. In the next chapter we
shall visit one of these valleys.</p>
<p>On the upper or south side of Marienburg, and immediately opposite,
is Punderich, famous for nothing except the following
legend:&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE GOLD CROWN.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A little way out of the village of Punderich stands a
small chapel, within which, on a stone altar, is a figure of the mother
of God. A crown of silver shines on her head, and a white veil flows
over her shoulders.</p>
<p>A long while ago the Virgin was crowned with a crown of pure gold;
but a wicked knight, named Klodwig, who owned many forts on the banks
of the river, passed by. When he was near to the chapel a great storm
arose, and the fierce thunder crashed round him. Seeing the chapel he
sought refuge there, and guided his horse up to the altar. Thankless
for shelter, on perceiving the crown he snatched it down from the
image&rsquo;s head, and placed it upon that of his courser.</p>
<p>No sooner was the sacrilege committed than off started the courser,
and fled frantically over the fields; the guilty knight, seeing the
river before him, endeavoured to throw himself down from his horse, but
before he could accomplish his purpose the river <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>received them, and down sank the gold crown, the
knight, and his charger.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>At the end of the Marienburg promontory, round which we are now
passing, is the village of Kaimt, and on the opposite shore stands the
bright town of Zell.</p>
<p>Zell is a flourishing place, extending along the bank of the river;
its general aspect is cheerful and new, but here and there an old house
with little quaint pinnacles reminds us of the age of the place. These
little old houses seem squeezed into corners by the pretentious
new-comers, whose elbows push into the ribs of the poor old fellows,
until their timbers or ribs are bulged out by the pressure.</p>
<p>There is a round tower above, and lines of poplars reach out of the
town; the mountain overhead is full of ravines, and bushes of stunted
growth here and there appear on the surface. A little higher up stream,
where the river turns round, resuming her course to the north, the
hills are most beautiful; for, covered with trees, the shadows as the
day lengthens creep on, and break into masses the huge cliffs and sons
of the forest.</p>
<p>Zell is renowned for the bravery of its inhabitants, which at one
time had passed into a proverb.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The village of Kaimt, from whose gardens the vine-wreaths sweep down
just over our heads as we pass, was always unlucky; as the weaker in
war go <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>to the wall, so, being close to the strong fort
of Zell and the fortified cloister of Marienburg, Kaimt was generally
burnt by one or other of the contending parties, and always plundered
by both.</p>

<p>Soon we reach Merl, where the Knight Carl of Zant lived, who loved
the Pale Nun of Marienburg. Many other distinguished families lived in
this town, which is very old, and full of quaint houses; its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>situation is very delightful: sheltered from
cold by the vine-covered mountain behind, it looks out on the bend of
the river, with Marienburg opposite and Alf in the distance.</p>
<p>Before arriving at Alf is Bullay. This charming town is celebrated
for its f&ecirc;tes and its gaiety; on one of its f&ecirc;tes, a noble
and numerous company being collected, the host of the party, a relation
of the Knight Carl of Zant, filled a huge bumper and asked one of his
guests, named Frederick of Hattstein, if he could drink it down at a
draught, as he thought he seemed afraid of his wine.</p>
<p>Frederick being a very strong man (not liking to be mocked), seized
a full cask that stood in the room and lifted it up; then exclaiming,
&ldquo;I take this draught in honour of the Elector of Tr&egrave;ves,
my good master;&rdquo; he finished the ohme.</p>
<p>Excited by this, and not wishing to be outdone by a stranger, the
host and his brother each seized a like cask, and emptied them in
honour of the Emperor and the Abbess of Marienburg: these three are
still known as the three topers of Bullay.</p>
<p>Without answering for the truth of this story, we believe it is an
undoubted fact, that in the &ldquo;old times&rdquo; German nobles daily
drank a portion of wine equal to about sixteen of our bottles.</p>
<p>We now arrive at Alf. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=

<p class="first">From Alf to Bad Bertrich an excellent road runs
winding through a succession of green valleys, shut closely in by the
mountains, which are covered with foliage. The Alf-bach, or brook, runs
by the side of the road; its waters turn the wheels employed in the
iron-works, which are embosomed in trees near the entrance of these
secluded valleys. So, after all, we find the fire-fiend is not
extinguished, but by the assistance of his friend Man is, as of old,
still defacing nature and enslaving a beautiful stream.</p>
<p>Six English miles of beauty bring us to Bad Bertrich itself. In all
probability, the tourist in Germany will here exclaim, &ldquo;I never
heard of Bad Bertrich.&rdquo; Even so, we reply; and that constitutes
one of its greatest charms. While the English, and Russians, and French
are all swarming to Baden, to Ems, Schwalbach, Wildbad, and the legion
of baths with which all Germany teems, there is left neglected one of
the most beautiful places in Europe. There is plenty of shade, and
plenty of sun, and plenty of air, and yet &ldquo;the Bad&rdquo; is
quite sheltered.</p>
<p>The village is very small and clean. There are several small inns,
and one good hotel, called Werling&rsquo;s. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>This
hotel is kept by an unmarried woman, who is one of the oddest,
best-hearted old bodies possible. She, however, is not the leading
person in the establishment, as everything is left to the waiter, a
remarkable character.</p>
<p>This waiter is an exceedingly jolly old fellow, who, as the day
advances, becomes more and more deeply in liquor; his eyes close up
gradually, and his senses seem to be wandering. Now these symptoms are
not unusual to men in his state; but it is most unusual for a man when
so overcome to be able to wait on some twenty or thirty guests, to
bring what is wanted for each, and to (without any notes) keep account
in his head of what wine and food each has partaken. Yet all this he
does, and does it right well.</p>
<p>In the winter this hotel is shut up, and our old friend the waiter
goes hunting with two apoplectic dogs, that snore on chairs all the
summer.</p>
<p>While we were there, his waiting, and drinking, and hunting were
nearly all brought to a sudden termination; for one night, while
sitting at supper, a tremendous smell of sulphur began to pervade the
apartment, and following our noses, we found that it came from a small
room to which the old waiter retired between courses to indulge in a
sip. By this time the smell was so strong, and on opening the door the
air became so dense, that it was all we could do to drag the old fellow
out. It then appeared that some visitors had given him a parcel of
fire-works to put safely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href=
"#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>aside, and he had <i>for
safety</i> placed them among matches and candle-ends, and somehow the
whole had exploded.</p>
<p>Adjoining the inn is the bath-house, and around it a garden and
promenade. Close by is a fountain, where the public drink the waters
for nothing. The baths cost one shilling each, and are most delicious.
The water flows through all the time you are in, and bubbles and
seethes round your body: the after-effect is to freshen and strengthen
the frame, while the nerves are all soothed.</p>
<p>The Herr Director is an old officer of engineers or artillery, and
speaks excellent English. He is a man of great taste, and has laid out
(at the expense of the Government) the walks and extensive grounds of
the place.</p>
<p>All over the woods and the valleys these walks wind through the
shade; and at all the best points of view are seats of wood or stone,
covered with bark. Often, too, summer-houses, with roofs that will keep
the showers from wetting the visitors, are met on the hills.</p>
<p>Bad Bertrich was well known to the Romans, who, in the fourth
century, erected a bath-house and other fine buildings. Remnants of
these are often turned up, and some are preserved.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth century these baths again became noted, but fell
again into disuse; but in 1769 the last Elector of Tr&egrave;ves had
the springs properly managed, and built the Kurhaus, which now stands.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>The bathing establishment, hotel and village, are clustered together
at one end of a circular valley. Precipitous cliffs shut in this
beautiful valley, round which a brooklet runs singing. The cliffs are
covered with forests of oak, beech, and other fine trees. The little
paths that wind round them are bordered with mountain-ash, through
whose red clusters of berries the green carpet which lies in the
valley, with the water splashing around it, is seen.</p>
<p>Two eminences in the green valley are surmounted by the two
churches: one is Protestant, and the other (the old one) is for Roman
Catholic worship.</p>
<p>A pleasant little society of Germans collect at this place, and
music enlivens the air; but the season is considered quite over in
September, and the music then goes away.</p>
<p>Water to drink and water to bathe in, and plenty of fresh air and
exercise, will render a stay at Bad Bertrich most pleasant; added to
which there are plenty of excursions to make, plenty of pleasant walks,
and objects to sketch; and wild flowers and rocks to examine; or
shooting for those so inclined.</p>
<p>One of the shortest and most beautiful walks about Bertrich is to
the K&auml;segrotte, or cheese grotto: this is a cave supported by
basaltic pillars which look as if made of cheeses placed one on the top
of the other. By the side of the cave tumbles a rill of water, which
flows from a most beautiful little pool above; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>over
the ravine is a rustic bridge, exceedingly well-constructed: the banks
are covered with trees.</p>

<p class="first">Close to this grotto is a seat commanding an exquisite
view of the Alf-bach; its course is blocked with masses of stone washed
down by its torrent: these stones form the brook into a succession of
little pools, in which the setting sun reflects his brightness. Paths
along the brook lead through groves in which seats, beautifully placed,
are dedicated to different German poets.</p>
<p>Another little spring, called the Peter&rsquo;s Brunnen, on the side
of the hill opposite the village, is famous for the extreme clearness
and coldness of its waters; the water is collected into a cistern, and
sitting in the shade under the rock which holds these cold waters, the
air is cool even on the hottest day. A lion&rsquo;s head allows the
imprisoned spring to send forth its waters, which trickle and splash
into a bason underneath.</p>

<p>The meadow that fills the valley of Bertrich is intersected with
walks, and gardens are being formed at the end farthest from the
village. Above these new gardens the Alf falls in a cascade over the
rocks; a part of the water is conducted into fish-ponds, that are to be
well stocked.</p>
<p>The Falkenlei is well worth visiting; it is a bare mass of rock,
that rears its head over the tree-tops on the summit of a mountain: it
is 160 feet high and 600 feet long; it is formed of basalt, and is
inhabited by foxes and falcons. It is supposed to be an extinct
volcano.</p>
<p>One of the best rambles is down the valley nearly to the village of
Alf, and then up the hills to Burg Arras; afterwards, explore the
Uesbach valley. But in all directions the walks are nearly equally
beautiful, and as only a visit can convey a proper idea of Bad
Bertrich, we will not endeavour to bring into mere words such beautiful
scenery: go and explore!</p>
<p>The first Knight of Arras was a brave man, who, at the time of the
Hunnish invasion, was a poor collier; he had twelve sons equally brave,
and they all fought so stoutly and well, that after the defeat of the
Huns the Pfalz-graf selected this collier as the bravest and best
warrior there, and causing him then to kneel down conferred on him the
order of knighthood and gave him this castle.</p>
<p>The Alf-bach, of which we here give a peep, falls into the Moselle
at the village of Alf, which is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195"
href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>a cheerful old town; as
usual, beautifully placed between the river and brook: it contains very
good little inns, and is a good point to rest at.</p>

<p>The steamers that ply on the Moselle are few in number, but very
well appointed. Sometimes in summer there is not enough water to enable
them to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>travel, and often a good bump is experienced
from some hidden rock. On one occasion we knocked quite a good-sized
hole in the bottom, and tore off a large piece of one paddle-wheel; but
there was not the slightest danger, as the water was not deep enough
for us to sink into it, so we pumped away for some time, and patched up
the hole. Shortly after we met the down-steamer, which had likewise
started a leak, and we were all much amused at the solemnity with which
our captain handed over to his friend a pump, which he knew would not
work, as he had tried it in vain in our boat. It was received with
gratitude.</p>
<p>There was a waiter on board this boat, whose sole object in life
seemed to be to cheat the passengers; his powers of <i>addition</i>
were very great, and only surpassed by his effrontery. There is a
printed tariff for everything, so his attempts were generally
unsuccessful; but, like a gallant fellow, he returned again and again
to the charge, nothing abashed; we frequently met this individual, and
although he must, after the first two or three attempts, have found out
that we were not to be done by him, yet up to our last settlement he
tried to overcharge; poor fellow, it was, we suppose, an innocent
mania, like some people have for pocketing lace. The living is good,
and the boats not at all crowded, which is better for the passengers
than the Company; and the officers are very polite.</p>
<p>A straight reach of the river brings us to Neef, which is completely
embosomed in trees, and the hills at its back are covered with vines.
On the opposite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199"
name="pb199">199</a>]</span>bank the bare rock abruptly approaches the
water; from it a road has been blasted.</p>

<p>The Government are yearly improving the navigation of our river, by
blowing up rocks and damming the stream.</p>
<p>There is a legend connected with Neef, nearly similar to that of St.
Brelade&rsquo;s Church in Jersey, which we have already laid before our
readers in <i>Channel Islands</i>. The following is the Moselle
version:&mdash;</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE ANGEL WORKMEN.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the hills above Neef is a graveyard, still used for
its original purpose. In this formerly stood a chapel, which was built
here for the following reasons:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>In olden times the chapel of Neef fell into a ruinous state, and
collections were made all about the Moselle country to enable the
village to rebuild their chapel. The holy communities in the
neighbourhood gave liberally, and soon sufficient being collected, the
work was begun.</p>
<p>To the surprise of the builders, every morning they found their
yesterday&rsquo;s labour undone, and the stones and other materials
carried up to where the graveyard now is.</p>
<p>The Pastor ordered night-watches to guard the new works, and punish
the guilty offenders.</p>
<p>The night closed around them, and the hours wore on without anything
happening to alarm the watchmen, when suddenly one exclaimed that the
stars were moving towards them. The eyes of all then beheld luminous
flakes, which, coming nearer and nearer, grew into angels, with bright
shining wings, and love on their brows.</p>
<p>The angels approached and gathered the stones, then bore them to the
hill-top, after which they receded again into heaven.</p>
<p>The materials thus consecrated were used for the purpose so clearly
pointed out, and the chapel was raised on the top of the hill, instead
of being hid in the valley beneath.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>A sharp turn to the left brings us to Bremm, an old rotten town,
with a good church. The people of Bremm seem more squalid than those of
any other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>town on the Moselle; whether they merely wish to
be in keeping with their houses or not, we did not ascertain.</p>
<p>Opposite Bremm is a fair promontory, on whose sloping green turf the
ruins of Kloster Stuben are seen. The hills on the left-hand bank bend
round in the form of a horse-shoe, and the river flows at their base.
The hills are very superb, of considerable height; and their grand
sombre mass contrasts with the green fields around Kloster Stuben.</p>
<p>This horse-shoe form constantly occurs on the Moselle; and not only
is the bend of the stream in the form of a horse-shoe, but the enclosed
space is usually shaped precisely as it would be had it been formed of
soft lava, and stamped by the gigantic foot of a horse. Perhaps the
Wild Huntsman rode here while the volcanoes were still in full
force.</p>
<p>The first Abbess of Kloster Stuben was Gisela the Fair; her father,
a knight, built the cloister, and endowed it as a resting-place for his
poor daughter Gisela, who thus lost her lover:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The fair Gisela sat in her bower, waiting impatiently
for her knightly bridegroom.</p>
<p>The sun watched with her all day, but at last, growing weary, sank
westwards.</p>
<p>Still Gisela watched&mdash;for love never wearies&mdash;and at
length she had her reward; for, rounding the cliffs, a noble bark came
gallantly on, and nearer and nearer <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>it glided until she
could see her loved knight, who stood looking eagerly up.</p>
<p>On seeing Gisela he shouted, and all his friends waved their hands.
His ardour could not be restrained to the vessel&rsquo;s slow motion,
and landwards he sprang to embrace his fair bride; but the leap was too
great, and the good knight sank down, overpowered by the weight of his
armour, and never rose more.</p>
<p>Gisela wept not, but her bosom became cold as the waters that closed
over the head of her lover, and she passed from the world into the
cloister of Stuben.</p>

<h3 class="main">A LIBEL ON NIGHTINGALES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The monks of Himmerode led dissolute lives, and Saint
Bernard was sent to reprove them, and endeavour to bring them back to a
sense of their duty.</p>
<p>In vain the Saint lectured&mdash;the monks were wicked as ever, and
the Saint in despair sought his chamber; there, opening his window, he
sat down to plan fresh arguments with which he might touch the wicked
hearts of the monks.</p>
<p>The music of the sweet nightingales swelled up to his ears, and
steeped his senses in bliss; but the Saint perceived, to his horror,
that wicked desires then arose in his breast: so, closing the window,
he hastened away. The thought then occurred to the Saint that, if the
songs of the nightingales thus affected so holy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>a
man as himself they must do infinite harm to the monks; he therefore
(having the power) banished the birds, and shortly the monks were
reformed.</p>
<p>The Abbess of Stuben, who gently ruled over a religious body of
nuns, hearing the nightingales had been driven out, and were wandering
in search of a home, invited them to settle in the meadows and groves
that surrounded her cloister.</p>
<p>The birds gladly arrived, and their songs, which had harmed the
wicked monks&rsquo; hearts, cheered and exalted the thoughts of the
pure-hearted nuns.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Nuns and nightingales are now alike departed, as well as the droning
old monks, whose notes we could better have spared.</p>

<p>There is a fine view from the cliffs behind the cloister, and the
walk hence to Beilstein is very agreeable, as the banks are all richly
wooded, and of a great height.</p>
<p>The river winds on past many a hamlet and burg; the forests and
vines succeed to each other; islands are passed, and the scene
constantly changes; spires rise among trees, old houses peep forth,
cattle wade in the stream, and our little skiff glides along until
Beilstein Castle appears, so beautifully placed, and so charmingly
surrounded by forest, that we at once stay the course of our boat, and
pull out our sketch-books. The townlet is nestled in walls, which are
adorned with several turrets, and over it stands up the sharp-pointed
spire of a church: the castle presides above all.</p>
<p>A great load of bark is slowly drifting down our river&rsquo;s
sparkling tide, and the boats are crossing and recrossing, filled with
busy husbandmen.</p>
<p>Where our boat now stands, once a gentle peasant girl found her
death and grave together, and with the latter peace, we trust.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE SHIPMASTER&rsquo;S DAUGHTER OF BEILSTEIN.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Kuno of Beilstein was struck with the beauty of a
shipmaster&rsquo;s daughter. She heard and responded to his love,
believing the words that he spoke.</p>
<p>The innocent dove cannot stand any chance with the hawk; so the poor
girl after a time found out, to her cost, when Kuno forsook her.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span></p>
<p>Madness seized on the brain of the wretched girl, and for a long
time her senses were wandering; but one morning in spring her memory
returned, and she begged her father to take her where she might gaze on
the castle of her false betrayer, for she loved him still.</p>
<p>Her father, who truly loved her, placed the poor girl in a boat, and
rowed up the river to where a good view of the castle was gained. She
gazed with tears on the spot, and prayed for the welfare of Kuno.</p>
<p>While gazing, a sound of horns and of dogs swept down the valley,
and as the shouting grew nearer Count Kuno was seen, with his young
haughty bride riding near him. Kuno, at seeing the girl in the boat,
started, and uttered her name. The young bride grew jealous, and
questioned the Count as to what he knew of the girl. He replied, she
was nothing to him; and, to pacify her, launched an arrow at his former
love.</p>
<p>The shot took effect, and the father, rushing to save her,
overbalanced the boat, and both father and daughter sank down for
ever.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Beilstein is not over-clean, although a stream runs through it; but
then it is the essence of picturesqueness, which more than makes up. It
seems to have been in former days a place of some importance, but with
the decay of the castle the town itself has decayed, and the walls
crumble down, and the houses are empty.</p>
<p>Many Jews live here, and it is said the dark-eyed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>Jewesses are very beautiful, and extremely
inquisitive about strangers, asking them many questions.</p>
<p>A series of valleys&mdash;all wooded, and watered, and
pleasant&mdash;lie at the back of Beilstein. Unfortunately the inns are
very poor, so it is not a good place to stop at; but if not very
fastidious, the accommodation will suffice for two or three nights; and
the white wine is good.</p>
<p>There still remain considerable portions of wall and fragments of
towers of the castle of Beilstein. Its situation is very happily chosen
for both beauty and strength. On the side over the town an ascent is
impossible. A narrow ridge connects the castle with the neighbouring
mountains; along this ridge is a path, which conducts us through
fruit-trees and vineyards to an old burial-ground, filled with
tombstones with Hebrew inscriptions. Here the Jews are buried
apart.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of our river is Poltersdorf, or the village of
blustering fellows; so called, because its inhabitants were always
quarrelling with those of the neighbouring hamlets.</p>
<p>The scenery from Beilstein to Cochem is not to be surpassed on our
river. There are mountains, beautiful churches and villages, trees,
rocks, and water, with happy faces smiling from under their picturesque
head-dresses.</p>

<p>Such was the hour and such the night on which the mad Pfalz-graf,
Henry of Cochem, slew his wife. Thus runs the tale in the
overture:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="main">LEGEND OF COCHEM.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Pfalz-graf Henry, called &ldquo;the Mad,&rdquo;
had a bitter quarrel with the Archbishop of Cologne, and had been
worsted in combat with the Archbishop&rsquo;s troops; retiring, he shut
himself up in his castle of Cochem.</p>
<p>As the evening drew on, the Pfalz-graf became more and more excited,
and strode to and fro in his chamber. The light of the full moon still
further added to his fury, and he raged like a lion confined in his
den, constantly calling on the Archbishop by name, and vowing vengeance
against him.</p>
<p>His gentle wife approaching him sought to soothe him with her
caresses, and addressed him with words of endearment. For a few moments
he seemed to be calmer; but then starting up, he seized a great axe and
struck his wife to the earth.</p>
<p>At seeing this monstrous deed, the attendants sprang forward; alas!
too late, for the gentle lady was dead.</p>
<p>The madman was seized and taken to the Archbishop of Tr&egrave;ves,
who had him confined in a cell, where he soon after died.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The town of Cochem is hid by the trees on our left as we look at the
castle: it contains about 2500 inhabitants, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>and
is a very clean, flourishing town. It contains very fair shops, and the
hotel is good. It is very picturesque; its streets are steep and
narrow, and the old walls and gate-towers add to its general appearance
of age. On market-days it is crowded with people from all the adjoining
villages, who sell their produce to dealers who supply the market of
Coblence. A little steamer bustles and puffs down the stream into
Coblence every day, and gets back again in the evening.</p>
<p>Cochem is a good resting-place, as in its neighbourhood are found
many interesting places, such as Beilstein, Marienbourg, Clotten,
Treis, Elz, &amp;c.; and immediately around it the country walks are
very numerous, varied in character, and beautiful.</p>
<p>Sitting in the balcony of the inn, too, is very pleasant; the
steamers, with their passing life, arrive and depart just opposite; the
great fleets of barges are pulled past by dozens of horses, at which
the drivers scream and crack their whips till the whole valley
resounds; fishermen ply their trade, and at night-time light fires on
the banks, that thus they may be able to see their prey in the
water.</p>
<p>Opposite is a small village, and behind this village are vineyards
belonging to Cochem; so the constant communication necessarily kept up
makes the river appear very lively. Boats also are generally being
built or repaired, and the girls are washing linen or carrying water up
from the stream.</p>
<p>Between Cochem and Beilstein there is, at a turn <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>of
the river, a beautiful cemetery, and a church with twin-spires. The
cliffs and river sweep round the angle and shut in this retired nook,
which, thus separated from the world, appears a fit resting-place for
those whose waking will be in a world more glorious than this. There
are on our river many cemeteries and graveyards, most beautifully
placed; and the graves, with their simple crosses, seem the realisation
of peace.</p>
<p>Nearer to Cochem is a very perfect echo; it repeats twice with great
clearness, and is so long before answering that there is time to say
quite a sentence. Thus it invited us to &ldquo;come again
to-morrow;&rdquo; and for many a morrow we visited and revisited the
scenery here, the endless foot-paths over rocks and through vines, or
forests, or fields, ever giving us new views and fresh combinations of
beauty, and we found days pass into weeks with the greatest
rapidity.</p>
<p>Following the brook at the end of the town, we arrive at the foot of
the hill on which the strong castle of Winneburg stands, midst its own
ruins. It has two sets of walls and moats, and must have been quite
inaccessible in the old time. It is difficult to get into it now, even
without anybody to poke a pike down one&rsquo;s throat, or pour molten
lead in your eyes.</p>
<p>Its situation is fine, and from it part of Cochem is seen, and the
castle of Cochem, which rises quite close to the town. It is curious
how deceptive these places are in size. What seems from below to be a
mere fragment of ruin, becomes, at your nearer approach, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>a
most extensive circuit of wall, with many roofless chambers and
turrets; just as we never know the size of a tree until it is
felled.</p>
<p>The legend of Winneburg, called &ldquo;the Immured Maiden,&rdquo;
merely relates that the master-builder who had contracted to finish the
keep within a certain time failed in his contract; and being reproached
by his employer, was about to jump into the Moselle from the walls: but
a stranger assured him, if he would allow him to build into the wall
the little daughter he loved so dearly, he would finish the keep in a
day. The rascal consented, and the devil built the little girl up in
the foundation of this strong keep-tower.</p>
<p>We doubted the truth of this story, as the master-builder must have
been a very active man to have jumped two miles and a half, which is
the distance from Winneburg to the Moselle.</p>
<p>Continuing our course from the hill on which Winneburg stands, we
enter a narrow part of the valley called the Enterthal. This Enterthal
consists of a series of openings in the very high hills; the openings
are exquisitely green lawns, surrounded by thick foliage and rock;
through or round these openings runs the brook, heaping up stones and
spreading into pools, or tumbling down headlong in its hurry to reach
its gentle sovereign the Moselle.</p>
<p>The path is rough, and constantly you have to hop from stone to
stone across the brook. Thus picking our steps, we came suddenly on a
most aristocratic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212"
name="pb212">212</a>]</span>fishing-party, consisting of the
burgomaster and his attendants, clad in blue, with red stripes to their
caps, and with naked legs. They seemed very successful in procuring
trout for the official supper. Their mode of fishing was not scientific
or sportsman-like,&mdash;an odd-shaped net, which they poked under the
banks, being the only tackle of this great man, who did not disdain to
wet his own Herr-burgomasterial legs in the pursuit.</p>
<p>After a long ramble an old mill is reached, and a good sketch found;
indeed, the whole walk was a sort of diorama of beautiful moving
pictures of rock, and tree, and water. The people we met in these
valleys were by no means civil; and we found out at last that their
incivility was caused by their thinking we were making plans to divert
the course of the stream, or otherwise injure their properties.</p>
<p>English ladies were evidently quite new objects of curiosity to the
people of Cochem. On leaving the hotel, the ladies of our party
immediately became objects to be pointed at, talked about, and stared
out of countenance. If the streets had been empty before their
appearance, there were always spies of some sort on the alert, who
called to doors and windows those who made a perpetual peep-show of
these wonderful strangers. Every tea-table and wine-party also, as we
were informed, discussed us, and wondered what could induce us to
remain at Cochem when we might be enjoying all the gaieties of
Tr&egrave;ves or Coblence. Although we passed weeks there their wonder
never diminished, nor did their curiosity cease. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>seemed to have no idea of scenery being worth
anything.</p>
<p>Luckily, this unpleasant curiosity was confined to the people of the
town; in the country a hearty &ldquo;<i lang="de">Guten tag</i>,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;<i lang="de">Gute nacht</i>,&rdquo; always greeted us, and
the greatest readiness to direct or assist us was always shown by the
peasants: one man was, it is true, exceedingly tickled at the idea of
our asking the way to a valley which we were already in, and could
scarcely answer for laughing. Evidently, too, they in general fancied
that so important a place as Something-<i>heim</i>, or whatever the
name of the place happened to be, ought to be well known to every
one.</p>
<p>The castle of Cochem affords a most agreeable retirement to those
who are fond of reading, sketching, or musing through the
summer&rsquo;s day: unlike the ruins on the Rhine, it is wholly
uninfested by beggars, donkeys, or venders of faded flowers and
wreaths. Here you may walk up the hill and enter by a stone bridge into
the outworks; perhaps a few sheep or goats, with an attendant boy, are
there: if not, Solitude holds his court amid the deserted walls.
Through the ruined window-arches the river is seen, and the town is
immediately under us: vines cover one side of the steep hill, and a
little chapel nestles itself into a corner where the rock shelters it
from stones; above rise the mountains, covered with cherry and other
trees to near the top, where young oaks supersede the less hardy
fruit-trees: a soft green lawn fills the space surrounded by the
outworks of the castle; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href=
"#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>in the centre stands the massive
keep, beside which is a smaller tower, and in the distance, Winneburg
is greyly visible.</p>
<p>Cochem was one of the three castles given up to the Countess of
Sponheim by Archbishop Baldwin, as a security for the heavy ransom she
made him pay: this happened in 1328. About the same period the Jews of
Cochem were massacred; the popular fury was raised against them by the
story of the supposed murder of the child Werner at Oberwesel on Rhine.
The truth appears to be, that the Jews had become richer than the other
members of the communities in which they lived, and therefore Envy
roused the populace to fury with a fictitious story of murder, and by
this means plundered the unfortunate Hebrews, who no longer lived to
protect their property.</p>
<p>Cochem suffered terribly when it was taken by Marshal Boufflers,
who, after devastating the Palatinate, advanced against this town;
thrice his troops were repulsed by the brave defenders, at length the
superior numbers of the besiegers forced an entrance, but with a loss
of 2500 men, among whom were six colonels: all the inhabitants that
remained alive after the pillage were sent into other countries, and
only a few ever found their way back. After the taking of the town the
cruelties exercised by the French troops were only surpassed by Tilly
at Magdebourg.</p>
<p>The assault took place on the f&ecirc;te of St. Louis, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>and
Boufflers sent the news of the taking and burning of Cochem to Louis
XIV. as a pleasant gift, well suited to the occasion.</p>
<p>The ch&acirc;teau of Winneburg was taken and sacked at the same
time. This castle afterwards became the family seat of the
Metternichs.</p>
<p>For a long time after these outrages, it is said that those who had
witnessed the dreadful scenes at the taking of Cochem were wont to
start up in their sleep, crying, &ldquo;The French! the
French!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing out of Cochem, as we continue on our flowery path, we find
ourselves in the shade of the Kreuzberg mountain: it is covered with
vineyards, which produce a small quantity of excellent wine.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The next town is Clotten; between it and Cochem a fine range of
rocky precipices form an amphitheatre, that dwarfs even the gigantic
works of the old Romans. What ants we appear when from a rock we look
down on our human mole-hills!</p>
<p>The church at Clotten is remarkably well placed on an eminence,
where its handsome proportions are seen to the greatest effect. The
town is very dilapidated and irregularly built: there are some very
picturesque houses in it still, but the old walls and gate-towers have
nearly all disappeared to make room for the vines.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4600width" id="p216"><img src="images/p216.jpg"
alt="Clotten Castle." width="706" height="596">
<p class="figureHead">Clotten Castle.</p>
</div>
<p>At a little distance from the town is the ruined tower, that alone
survives of the former castle of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216"
href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>Clotten; it is partially
undermined, and a great hole broken into its centre. The castle of
Clotten was extensive, and very strong; at one time it was the
residence of a queen, Richenza of Poland. She was the wife of Miceslaus
II., and during her husband&rsquo;s lifetime she managed all the
affairs of the kingdom: at his death she was made Regent during her
young son&rsquo;s minority, but the Poles drove her out of their
kingdom, and she took refuge with her son Casimir in Clotten: here she
shut herself up, and Casimir became a monk. Some years after, a
deputation from Poland waited on Casimir, and begged him to return to
Poland as king; this he did, the Pope releasing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>him
from his vows on the whimsical condition that all the Poles of good
birth should cut their hair close to the point of the ear, in perpetual
recollection of their king having been a monk.</p>
<p>Richenza endeavoured to persuade her son not to accept the throne,
but her arguments did not convince him of the vanity of royalty; she
remained in this country, constantly residing at Clotten Castle, near
which she built a hermitage with a chapel, to which she often
retired.</p>
<p>A fine reach of the river is seen from the ruin, and behind it is a
deep valley, in which one or two mills are just perceptible through the
trees that envelope the course of the brook which turns their great
wheels.</p>
<p>The spires of the churches are in general finely pointed, the one at
our feet, as we stand here, is a fair example of their style of
architecture. On Sundays and f&ecirc;te-days they are crowded; often
they are so full, that late-comers are obliged to stand in the doorway
or outside: the crowd is made up of both men and women; the
head-dresses of the latter are gay and graceful. The embroidered cloth
or velvet covering the thick plaits of the unmarried girls, the close
caps of the old women, and the smart streaming ribbons of the young
wives, make the heads of the crowd like a bed of tulips.</p>
<p>The men always wear blue blouses and black hats, or plain cloth
caps, so they are commonplace-looking enough: the boatmen are alone, of
their sex, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>picturesque; a red cap sets them off amazingly,
and they seem to have a very good opinion of themselves, if we may
judge by the ease with which they joke the <i>m&auml;dchen</i> they
pass on their voyage.</p>
<p>A good many fish are caught in the river, but they are generally
small. All day long solitary men sit in boats, and at long intervals
dip up and down nets that move on a pole at the end of a swivel: they
must have immense patience, and consume, we should suppose, the greater
part of their earnings in the tobacco that they constantly smoke. The
casting-net also is much used, but then there must be two men, one to
pole the boat into the rapids while the other swings in his net.</p>

<p>From Cochem, an easy walk brings the tourist within reach of no less
than seven castles,&mdash;viz. Beilstein, Cochem, Winneburg, Clotten,
Treis, Elz, and Pyrmont. The first four we have already noticed: in
this chapter we will make a walking tour to the other three named.</p>
<p>Leaving Clotten behind us, we walked on, under a broiling sun, to
Pommern. At the back of Pommern is a long, winding, narrow valley,
through which the Pommerbach runs. Where it enters the Moselle, the
banks of our river are covered with turf and shade-spreading trees.
Under these latter we lay, enjoying the cool after our hot, dusty walk.
The brook was nearly dry, so we made an agreement with a wild-looking
girl, who was watching some cows drink in the river, that she should
for the sum of twopence sterling fetch us a pannikin of fresh, cold
water, we stipulating to look after her cows in the meanwhile.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>We found our task rather difficult, as the cows
were a most unruly set of brutes, who, not recognising our authority,
wished to make their way into the adjoining gardens. At length,
however, the water arrived, and the bargain was completed.</p>
<p>Most luxurious was the fresh well-water, the tree-shade, and the
rest: a cigar also lent its &ldquo;enchantment to the view,&rdquo;
which embraced a reach of the river, with the woods on its shores,
glowing in the noonday haze. Close to us was an ancient ch&acirc;teau,
with its high-peaked roof and many gables; a tower was at one end, and
over the roof appeared the church spire. The brook trickled past, and
the pollard willows on its green banks marked its course down to the
river. The ch&acirc;teau is now only used as a farm, and the upper part
was stored with hay. Formerly it was the residence of a knight, who
held it in fief from the Archbishop of Tr&egrave;ves.</p>
<p>Our river lay so still, so clear, so blue beneath us; she also
seemed resting till the heat should pass. The mountains, towers, and
towns were watching as she slept over the glorious beauty of our Fairy
Queen Moselle. As of old, in her earliest days, the freshness of purity
still was in her waters,&mdash;still innocence and beauty were combined
in her azure form; but who shall describe the glory of her maturity,
the loveliness of her now perfected form?</p>
<p>It was noontide, and no foot was stirring. The birds had ceased
their songs, the trees were motionless, and the still mountains were
repeated in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221"
name="pb221">221</a>]</span>stream, as though they had plunged from
their burning heights headforemost into the cool wave.</p>
<p>And thus we sat and mused: speech would have been desecration. Peace
was on the earth! What sermons Nature preaches!&mdash;always eloquent
and simple. How she touches our hearts, and teaches us the truth; while
human eloquence, with all its art, fails to impress or rouse us from
our state of apathy! What lessons may be learnt, what blessings gained,
in a summer&rsquo;s ramble by rivers&rsquo; banks, and through the
mighty forest, where the silence is more eloquent than words; or on the
mountain-tops, where earth seems already left behind, and the sky
appears almost within our reach!</p>
<p>A little below Pommern, where a large island ends, we crossed to
Treis, and went through the meadow valley to the base of the rock on
which Treis Castle stands. It was a good climb to the summit, and the
path appeared as unfrequented as the forest round the princess who
slept until an adventurous knight woke her with a kiss.</p>
<p>The castle of Treis belonged to a very ancient family, who sent
knights to the Holy Land under Godfrey de Bouillon. Afterwards it
passed into the hands of Queen Richenza of Poland, who gave it to the
Convent of Brauweiler, and it was henceforth garrisoned for the Church
by dependants of the Archbishop of Tr&egrave;ves.</p>
<p>On one occasion, the Pfalz-graf of the Rhine sent word to the
Governor of the castle that the Church <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>did not want forts,
as it was sufficiently protected by the Divine power. The Governor
acquainted the Bishop, and he excommunicated the Pfalz-graf for his
impiety (a step the bishops always seem to have taken in their personal
quarrels). The Pfalz-graf, however, did not care for the Bishop&rsquo;s
threats, and took the castle.</p>
<p>The angry Bishop assembled an army, and marched to retake this
Church property. He soon appeared before the castle, and, with his
crucifix in his hand, summoned it to surrender, and upbraided the
Pfalz-graf for seizing it.</p>
<p>The Pfalz-graf, seeing the army of the Bishop was too numerous for
him to contend with successfully, began to think the Bishop&rsquo;s
arguments were strong ones, so he quietly gave up the castle.</p>
<p>The poet ends by saying what may be thus almost literally
translated:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The Cross a perfect victory gained,</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Thus was its mightiness maintained.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This castle is curiously constructed. It is placed on
the summit of a neck of land, both sides of which are precipitous. The
keep is at the outer extremity of this neck, and the high rock on which
it stands towers perpendicularly from the valley to the height of some
four hundred feet. The main part of the castle was on the neck of land,
and at the inner end of the neck was a very strong gate-tower and other
buildings. These three portions of the castle were joined together by
strong walls: but if the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href=
"#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>gate-tower was forced the garrison
could first of all defend the centre, which was divided by a great
ditch from the gate-tower; and, finally, they could retire into the
keep, which formed a castle in itself. Thus the assailants had to take
three separate fortresses.</p>
<p>The tower and considerable fragments of the other parts of this
castle still remain, wrapped in solitude. The old hall can still be
traced. Where the knights caroused and the ladies smiled is now the
haunt of the owl, who sleeps among the branches of ivy that are
gradually forcing out the stones from the old walls.</p>

the old toll-house, the landing-place.</p>

<p>On the hill opposite Carden is a chapel high upon a rock: the road
leading to it has at intervals shrines, at which the religious
processions halt on their way to the chapel. Through the vineyards
inland of the town there is also a road, with shrines at every ten
yards; this likewise leads up to a Calvary chapel. Carden, in the
number of its religious edifices, surpasses all the other small towns
on the river.</p>
<p>Many of these buildings are now secularised into barns and
outhouses, but the church of St. Castor has just been repaired, as also
a small, elegant chapel, that stands close to the river.</p>

<h3 class="main">LEGEND OF ST. CASTOR.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For many years St. Castor lived in the forest, eating
nothing but herbs, and drinking only from the clear spring. He taught
the Gospel to all, and was much reverenced by his hearers.</p>
<p>The people, who were living in rough huts in the forest, now
collected by St. Castor, built a village, and raised a church to the
glory of God. His work completed, the Saint died; and in the course of
centuries men forgot where his body had been laid, until a certain
priest dreamt, and in his dream it was revealed to him where the Saint
slept. Thrice this dream was repeated; so, going to the Bishop of
Tr&egrave;ves, the priest told him what had occurred. Search was then
made, and the bones of the Saint were discovered; and over them was
raised the stately church <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=
"#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>which we see at the present day,
and which is dedicated to this good Saint.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Brauer&rsquo;s Inn is good, and Carden is a very interesting old
place. The space near the church is surrounded by funny-looking,
high-peaked old houses, a group of which we here give.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4776width" id="p226"><img src="images/p226.jpg"
alt="" width="542" height="292"></div>
<p>The highly picturesque and interesting castle of Elz is about four
miles distant from Carden. It is situated on a great rock in a narrow
valley, and surrounded on three sides by the Elz brook, that nearly
encircles the rock. The hills surrounding are higher than the rock the
castle is on, and completely shut it in. They are densely covered with
forests, full of roe-deer: hares, foxes, and occasionally wolves, are
shot there in winter.</p>
<p>The lord of the castle sometimes comes there to shoot, or to fish in
the Elz brook, which is swarming with trout.</p>
<p>We slept in Carden, so as to have the whole day <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>to
explore the valley of Elz; and early the following morning we set off
over the hills, passing out from the town under one of its little old
gateways, several of which still remain.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4787width" id="p227"><img src="images/p227.jpg"
alt="" width="525" height="545"></div>
<p>Coming suddenly on Elz as we gained the top of the mountain above
it, the view was very striking; we might have been living in the dead
centuries, it looked so perfectly habitable; and yet there was such a
quaint look about it, it seemed scarcely real. Soon after we met some
of the Count&rsquo;s people going out with dogs and guns: they were
dressed after the fashion of huntsmen whose representatives appear
nowadays only in theatres,&mdash;at least, so we thought until now.</p>
<p>On reaching the castle, we found it more ruinous <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>than
we at first had supposed. On ringing a bell we were admitted, and shown
over the rooms, in which are preserved many old pieces of armour, arms,
pictures, and furniture; also spoils of the chase.</p>
<p>The shapes of the rooms, and the staircases leading to them, are
wonderful: two American artists were hard at work, sketching interiors
and old furniture.</p>
<p>We read of a knight, George of Elz, so far back as the tenth
century, figuring at a tournament at Magdebourg; and the family holding
this castle were always of the highest consideration. But they appear
to have been a very turbulent race, and much given to quarrelling
amongst themselves, even on some occasions slaying each other; and a
family agreement was signed by three of the brothers, who seem to have
all resided at Elz, which concluded with the following extraordinary
terms:&mdash;&ldquo;He of us who shall during this peace kill either
his brother or son (from which God defend us!) shall be forced to quit
the house, and neither he nor his heirs shall have any rights over the
castle of Elz, unless expiation for such mortal sin shall be made. He
of us who shall disable one of the others, or his wife or child, shall
quit the house and never return. He of us who shall wound or stab the
other, shall be banished the house for a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wonderful treaty provided that they should assist each other
against their common enemies, and they appear to have done so.</p>
<p>Of course, a castle inhabited by such a set of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>quarrellers is haunted by the ghosts of those
murdered; thus Elz is particularly rich in such stories. But, in
general, they are only commonplace ghosts,&mdash;just ladies knocked
into the valley beneath for not kissing an importunate lover, or built
into a wall by a jealous husband; or a mournful murderer, who howls
through the long winter&rsquo;s nights in expiation of his crimes here
committed. In winter time the occupants must need large fires and a
good cask of wine to keep out these troublesome spirits. A better one
of these ghosts is a lady, who came by her death in the manner recorded
in the following version of</p>

<h3 class="main">THE PERFORATED HARNESS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Lady Bertha of Elz was left by her brother, who
had gone to fight in the Holy Land, to take care of the castle of Elz;
her lover, Count Edmund, had died, and she mourned for him whom she so
dearly had loved.</p>
<p>One evening, when the stars were consoling her for the loss of her
lover, she sat gazing on them, and tranquillity fell on her heart.</p>
<p>The hours silently passed, and the lady prepared for her rest,
little thinking how near to its final repose life was passing. Suddenly
she saw glittering of helmets, and heard noises of clanking of armour
below in the valley. Rousing her attendants, Bertha armed herself in a
light suit of mail, and went forth with her esquires and adherents to
oppose the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>robbers, who came like caitiffs to attack a
female by night.</p>
<p>Advancing in front of her friends, the courageous lady addressed the
leaders of the marauders, asking why thus they attacked her. An arrow,
launched from an unseen bow, pierced her harness: this was the only
reply. Bertha fell dying, and her soldiers rushed on and defeated the
foe.</p>
<p>The Lady Bertha was laid in a grave near the castle, over which a
weeping willow still points out the spot; and in the still, starlight
nights, she and her lover, happy in death, sit hand-in-hand, contented
and silent.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The castle of Elz was at length taken from its proper possessors by
the Archbishop Baldwin of Tr&egrave;ves, who, although outwitted by
Lauretta of Sponheim, seems generally to have worsted his enemies.</p>
<p>There had been a long feud between the knights and the Bishop, who
at last vowed to reduce them to obedience. He accordingly besieged the
castle in form, and, in order to cut off all supplies, caused a new
castle to be erected on the rocks opposite (a fragment of it still
exists). This new castle he filled with armed men, and at length the
knights of Elz agreed to own the warlike Bishop for their liege lord,
and henceforth they held the castle as vassals.</p>

<p>Three or four miles higher up the valley of Elz is the castle of
Pyrmont. It is romantically seated on rocks which border the stream
that a little lower <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232"

<p class="first">Retracing our steps down the valley of the Elzbach, we
found a good path leading through the bottom of the vale. Little
meadows bordered the brook which we were compelled to cross frequently,
but the great stepping-stones afforded a sure footing over the stream
in which the trout were greedily rising at flies. It was evening, and
on our left the dense foliage was glowing in light, while the meadows
and opposite hills were in shade with little puffs of grey spreading in
thin lines among the trees.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the valley we came upon Moselkern, and put up at a
tidy little inn, where the young lady of the house rather despised two
travellers who had no baggage but what their capacious pockets
contained. She was a pretty girl, and doubtless a village belle, so had
a right to give herself airs. She, however, relented, and became more
polite, when we, regardless of expense, ordered the best wine, which
cost at least eighteen-pence a bottle.</p>
<p>In all these inns, we observed that the landlord or his
representative thought it a matter of necessity to sit and keep company
with his guests, even if they did not talk.</p>
<p>Moselkern we found to be a cheerful village, very prettily placed
among the trees, just below where the Elz brook falls into the Moselle.
Between it and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>the river is a broad, green piece of land, where
boat-building is generally going on.</p>
<p>Here the youth of the place bathe, and the inhabitants meet to
discuss the prospects of the coming vintage, and rejoice or mourn over
the past one.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a great leaning towards the French on the banks
of our river. In most of the villages there is to be found some old
soldier, who expatiates to his listeners on the glorious days of the
old Napoleon; and many of the better class of villagers speak a sort of
mongrel French. Even among the lowest, French expressions are
common.</p>

</div>
<p>Three more castles now claim our attention; they were all places of
great importance. Bischofstein appears to have been, as its name
denotes, garrisoned for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href=
"#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>the Bishop (of Tr&egrave;ves),
while Thuron and Ehrenburg were held by adherents of the Count
Palatine, or other enemies of the Elector of Tr&egrave;ves.</p>
<p>Pursuing our course down the river, we left Moselkern by a path
running through gardens, whose hedgerows are vines trained on a
lattice-work. We found the peasants digging up fine potatoes, so
congratulated them on their crop, and also on the appearance of the
grape bunches; but people are never satisfied, and they said,
&ldquo;Yes, it is very good for the wine, and the corn, and potatoes,
but the garden greens are all burnt up with the sun:&rdquo; we thought
of the wretched farmer, whose potatoes were all so large there were no
little ones for the pigs.</p>
<p>Bischofstein is finely placed on a spur of the rugged mountain;
beneath it is a chapel and farmhouse: vines grow in the castle-yard,
and wherever a shelf of level ground can be made into soil fit for
their cultivation.</p>
<p>There is a great white stripe round the middle of the tower, which
the popular belief attributes to a deluge which submerged all the
valley, and only stayed its course when half up the tower of this
castle; the account given in the following tale is more
probable:&mdash;</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE BISHOP&rsquo;S SERMON.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The country round Bischofstein was swarming with
robber-knights and pillagers of every degree, to such an extent, that
the Archbishop Johann of Tr&egrave;ves sent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>out
a strong band of knights, who took up their abode in the castle of
Bischofstein.</p>
<p>The knights stayed the ravages, and soon the robbers found their
occupation gone, and good living on plunder a thing of the past; so
they took counsel together as to what should be done.</p>
<p>The robbers determined that Bischofstein must be taken and the
knights in its garrison slain; therefore, with the utmost secrecy, a
plan was concocted by which they succeeded in entering the castle by
stealth: thus they were able to seize on the knights and their
servants, and they slew every one.</p>
<p>A poor peasant who was in the fort contrived to escape, and he
carried the tidings to the Archbishop, who sent out an army, which
arrived at the fort and found all the robbers sleeping, quite drunk:
these they quickly despatched, and the fort was regarrisoned.</p>
<p>Then the Bishop Johann caused a white line to be made round the wall
of the tower, that all rogues should see, and by noting the fate of the
robbers preserve themselves from the stern hand of justice.
&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;I preach them a sermon by
which evildoers from sin may be saved; if they heed not this warning,
the sword must preach in <i>its</i> turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hatzeport, which we pass on the way to the castle of Ehrenburg, is a
well-built, well-to-do place, with a fine church. It stands at the
entrance of one of the innumerable valleys that break the great ridges
of mountain that shut in the course of our river. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>Crossing from thence to the village of Brodenbach, we enter a gorge
of the hills which conducts us to the beautiful valley, at the far end
of which the castle of Ehrenburg seems hanging in air.</p>
<p>The contrast of the sweet smiling valley, with its brook murmuring
along, makes the stern fortress more gloomy. Leaving the valley, we
gradually ascend by a footpath, until at length we reach where the
draw-bridge formerly stood; now there is but the stone pillar that used
to sustain it.</p>
<p>Some rough steps lead up to the gate-tower, and a ring at the bell
brought a chubby-faced child, that looked much out of place amid the
ruins. We entered, and an old dreamy man took the place of the child;
he led us through a ruined garden that surrounded a tower of immense
thickness, entering which he slowly led us by a winding road, that
would admit six men to mount abreast, up to the summit of the
tower.</p>
<p>To our surprise we now were on a piece of level ground; this tower,
which was the only entrance, having been built on a lower ledge of
rock.</p>
<p>The garden we were in was neatly kept and full of vegetables; at its
extremity stood the castle, from the centre of which, and on a still
higher piece of rock, the donjon keep, with its twin towers, rose up:
these towers are circular, and joined by a double wall.</p>
<p>All round outside the walls was air; the valley seemed far away: for
hundreds of feet, a pebble that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239"
href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>we dropped fell down,
striking nothing till it came into the depths of the valley. Much of
the ruin still remains, and the old man showed us how we might ascend
to the top of the twin towers.</p>
<p>There we sat wrapped in solitude, the valleys far beneath us, and
the hills spread out like a raised map, with here a tint of green where
trees should be, and there a grey patch for rock, while over them shone
out a bit of molten silver where our river flowed: so was the whole
country charted out for us, and here for hours we sat, our senses
drinking with delight from the pure well of fresh, sweet pleasure
raised by our most novel situation.</p>
<p>The old man sat still beneath us; and the records in our hand told
us what the old guide could not, the legends of the place.</p>
<p>The Knights of Ehrenburg were vassals of the great Counts of
Sponheim, and very powerful in council and war; the last of the race
was Count Frederick, who, according to the Chronicle of Limburg, burnt
down a great part of Coblence: his reason for so doing appears in the
following legend:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="main">THE LAST KNIGHT OF EHRENBURG.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Count Frederick of Ehrenburg was the last of his race,
his father had died while he was yet young. Feeling his castle to be
lonely without a companion, he looked far and near to find a fair lady
whom he might love and bring home to be mistress of Ehrenburg.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having found a suitable lady, he begged her hand from her father,
saying that he would give her his castle, his name, and his sword as a
dower; but the grim old warrior replied, that though his castle was
strong and name great, yet his sword was too bright, too glittering,
and new; and added, that his daughter&rsquo;s husband must be able to
show some marks of hard fighting on sword or on person. The old warrior
further suggested that the young Count should burn Coblence, as he had
a feud with that town.</p>
<p>Count Frederick retired and collected his friends, with whom he made
many inroads on the burghers of Coblence, and at length he succeeded in
burning a part of the town.</p>
<p>He immediately repaired to his loved lady&rsquo;s castle, when, to
his great annoyance, he found the fair one was flown. Having heard of
her father&rsquo;s wicked promise, that he would give her in marriage
when Coblence was burnt, she had retired from the world, and in a
nunnery was endeavouring to atone for the crime of her father.</p>
<p>The young Count raged and swore, and eventually took to his bosom a
different lady, but no children were granted them, so he was the last
of his race.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The records go on to relate how this last Count, having no son of
his own, adopted one of the sons of a friend; this boy&rsquo;s name was
Walter, and he met with the adventure described in the tale

<h3 class="main">THE TIMELY WARNING.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was Carnival in Coblence&mdash;all the world was
there; the streets were thronged with masks, shows and processions were
in all the public places; music, dancing, and merriment, reigned
supreme.</p>
<p>Walter, the adopted son of the Count of Ehrenburg, longed to visit
the gay scene, but the Count had never yet permitted him to go so far
away; at length, by dint of importunity, he got leave to set out, but
was strongly cautioned to meddle with no one, and avoid all disputes or
quarrels: with two stout men-at-arms he went forth.</p>
<p>When arrived at Coblence, he went first to an hotel by the shore; in
the windows of this hotel stood the young Count of Isenburg with a
beautiful girl, and many of the Count&rsquo;s servants were loitering
about the doors of the inn.</p>
<p>The Count of Isenburg, on seeing young Walter, commenced forthwith
to mock him, and sneered at the lad&rsquo;s scanty retinue. Walter was
angry, but, remembering his promise not to quarrel or fight, strode
into the house without saying a word.</p>
<p>Walter had nearly forgotten the incident, and was gazing on the gay
crowd that moved to and fro over the old Moselle bridge and in the road
under his windows, when a soft low knock came to the door. On opening
he found the beautiful girl that he had seen by the side of Count
Isenburg; she hastily entered, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242"
href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>and said, &ldquo;Noble youth,
you must hasten away, for the Count is now gone into the town to excite
the townspeople against you, and unless you depart with great speed,
the people, who hate your family, will certainly seize you.&rdquo; She
added that, like him she addressed, she did not belong to a noble
family, but her father being Count Isenburg&rsquo;s vassal, she was
forced to dissimulate and receive his attentions till she could make
her escape.</p>
<p>She had scarcely done speaking when the Count appeared in the
doorway, his naked sword in his hand, and fury flashing out from his
eyes. &ldquo;What dost thou here, venal wench!&rdquo; he cried out;
&ldquo;how darest thou speak to this Bastard?&rdquo; Then, running at
Walter, he sought to slay him while off his guard.</p>
<p>But Walter, hastily drawing his sword, not only parried his thrusts,
but wounded him sorely; then, whispering adieu to the girl Wallrade,
who had given him so kind and timely a warning, he sought out his
servants, and rode forth from the town, not without some sharp
exchanges of blows between them and the Coblencers, who were collecting
in haste to oppose their outgoing.</p>
<p>The Count of Isenburg and a party of citizens followed soon after,
and besieged the castle of Ehrenburg; but the garrison mocked them, and
when the besiegers retired, they advanced upon Coblence, and burnt down
the suburbs.</p>
<p>Walter contrived to rescue from durance the girl Wallrade, who,
together with her father, had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243"
href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>thrown into prison; but the
chronicle does not relate whether he married his fair preserver or
no.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>After an afternoon spent at Ehrenburg we returned to the village of
Brodenbach, where there are several clean little inns.</p>
<p>The great castle of Thuron well merits its name of &ldquo;the Throne
Castle;&rdquo; it stands on the heights above Alken, which is a
considerable village at a short distance from Brodenbach.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e5046width" id="p243"><img src="images/p243.jpg"

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>At Alken, and in the vicinity, many Roman coins, coffins, and pieces
of armour, have been found; so it is probably a place of considerable
antiquity. It is sheltered by a bold rock that juts into the stream,
and was connected with the castle of Thuron by a line of towers, which
still remain standing in the surrounding vineyards.</p>
<p>On the preceding page we have given a sketch of one of the little
chapels, with a line of shrines on each side of the steps that lead up
to it; these shrines and chapels form a leading feature in the Moselle
scenery. Nestled under the side of the hill on which the great castle
of Thuron stands, this little chapel, with its sharp-pointed spire, is
in fine contrast to the huge cliff and massive walls; but there is a
look of age about it and the old houses near which renders the whole
scene in perfect keeping.</p>
<p>On leaving the river to explore our way up to Thuron, we enter one
of those beautiful valleys into which the hills so constantly break; a
clear trout-stream runs through it, and the mountains close it in on
all sides.</p>
<p>One or two labourers are past, a &ldquo;good day&rdquo; exchanged,
and then we commence the ascent, which is long and steep. The path lies
through a wood, and not a single person did we meet in our walk, after
leaving the valley, until on the top of the hill we found some
wood-gatherers. Here the castle with its two towers appeared; it is the
most stately ruin we ever saw, very extensive, grandly placed, and so
inaccessible, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>that when we arrived at the base of its outer
wall we could not get in.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Thuron Castle.</p>
</div>
<p>At last we managed to scramble through a window, and then luxuriated
in the great ruin; blocks of stone and bushes usurp the ancient place
of knights and ladies, and no sound is heard but the song of birds.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>This castle was built by the Count Palatine
Henry, in 1209, after he came back from the Holy Land; he was the
delegate of his brother, the Emperor Otho IV., and he exercised a
sovereign power over the countries adjoining the Moselle. He often
resided in his new castle, and had many feuds with the Archbishops of
Tr&egrave;ves and Cologne, who enjoyed certain rights of sovereignty in
Alken.</p>
<p>These discords gave rise to the celebrated siege of Thuron. It is
celebrated, not so much for the deeds of valour there carried on, as
for the extraordinary quantity of wine there drunk,&mdash;no less than
three thousand cartloads having been consumed by the besiegers
alone.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">SIEGE OF THURON.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Knight Zorn commanded for the Count Palatine in
his strong castle of Thuron, when the Archbishop of Tr&egrave;ves
advanced and laid siege to it. The commander of the castle, who was
supported by a brave garrison, amply provisioned, laughed the besiegers
to scorn.</p>
<p>Finding they made no progress, the Archbishop&rsquo;s Commander sent
to the Archbishop of Cologne for assistance. This was willingly
granted, and the united armies blockaded the castle. Zorn expected
daily that they would deliver an assault, but to his surprise, day
after day and night after night went by, and no movement took place in
the camps of his enemies; eating and drinking seemed their sole
occupation.</p>
<p>Every house in the neighbourhood was ransacked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>by
the troops of the Church, and every cellar was emptied; carts also
arrived in long strings, bringing great butts of wine. Thus they went
on drinking and singing, while Zorn from above looked on astonished at
these most unusual proceedings.</p>
<p>Occasionally a herald arrived, and summoned Zorn to surrender; but
no assault was delivered.</p>
<p>The empty casks of the Church were piled up in heaps, and at the end
of two years they formed a mass which looked like a great fortress; and
a message was sent to the castle, that if the garrison did not
surrender they would continue to drink till the whole country was dry,
and the empty casks sufficient to form a fortress larger and stronger
than Thuron.</p>
<p>Zorn now agreed to capitulate, and at length it was settled, that he
and his garrison should retire unmolested, that the soldiers of Cologne
should at once leave the country, and that the castle should be
dismantled.</p>
<p>One unlucky personage appears to have been excluded from this
pacific arrangement: this was a village magistrate, who had acted as
spy for the besieged. He was taken by the conquerors, and a rope having
been stretched over the ravine, between the castle and the hill of
Bleiden, he was suspended at an immense height from the ground.</p>
<p>Another version of this story makes the magistrate-spy to walk
across ropes so stretched over the valley; and it is added, that he
accomplished the feat, and in gratitude built the chapel which we see
(now in ruins) on the hill to the right of the castle. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>The views from Thuron are very extensive, a long reach of the river
leads the eye back to the villages and cliffs we have past; undisturbed
by those infesters of the Rhine, who turn every place of interest on
that river into a tea-garden, we can here enjoy our meditations without
hindrance, and muse our fill.</p>

<p>The rock that projects into the river below Alken was formerly a
very dangerous point for boats to pass; now, owing to the submerged
portions having been blasted, it is no longer regarded with terror: but
still we see a saint&rsquo;s image placed in a niche of the rock, so
that he may be near if required to render any assistance. The summit of
this rock is level, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250"
name="pb250">250</a>]</span>and some hundreds of acres of corn are
grown on the curious table-land thus formed.</p>
<p>The road from Alken to Coblence is very indifferent, but not so bad
as represented by the coachmen of Coblence. One who drove us told us
beforehand, that a short time previous a lawyer going this road was
upset, and had not since left his bed; but as we found that the road so
abused was perfectly safe if ordinary care was taken, we suspected
that, like the man in the play, who wished &ldquo;every soldier would
kill a lawyer and take the legal consequences,&rdquo; the learned
gentleman&rsquo;s driver must have had some spite against him. Our
driver was a funny fellow, and among other things, speaking of a
village we were passing, he said, &ldquo;They make excellent wine
there, although they are Protestants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At K&uuml;r we found so clean and pleasant an inn, that we stopped
for the night. As we were resting at one of the open windows, through
which the still evening was visible, suddenly the shutters flapped to,
and in an instant the water was ruffled, the wind howling, and
everything creaking and slamming.</p>
<p>The storm grew louder and fiercer, the waters were boiling: then
came a crash through the hills, as if the mountains were rent; the rain
poured in jets from the sky, the blackness of which was illumined by
lightning, which at short intervals flashed over the valley.</p>
<p>Soon the storm had passed by, and the ever calm moon was floating
serenely in heaven. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251"
name="pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p>The lights of the stars fell tremulously down on the still agitated
waters. The air was so sweetly refreshing, that we sat on and on
enjoying the now lovely evening, till we were quite startled by being
suddenly summoned to supper,&mdash;not exactly startled at the notion
of supper, but astonished to see the ghost of a first-rate-inn waiter,
for such our summoner seemed, clad, not in grave-clothes, but clothes
of grave hue, and a white handkerchief, folded with the greatest
precision, round his waitership&rsquo;s neck. We had so long been
absent from civilisation, that we were rather abashed at so fine a
gentleman waiting on us rugged wayfarers, as we appeared; so we came
quietly up to our table, modestly ate, and retired to our rooms.</p>
<p>In the morning, to our relief, we found our stately waiter in his
shirt-sleeves and not very dandy continuations; so we mustered up
courage to settle our bill, and departed, to revel among uncivilised
castles.</p>
<p>K&uuml;r was formerly a domain belonging to the Archbishop Poppo. He
gave it to the ecclesiastics of the Cathedral at Tr&egrave;ves, and the
wine there produced&mdash;which was more than sixty tons
annually&mdash;was used by the recipients as table-wine, the surplus
serving to pay for its transport: thus they drank their wine at no
cost. The Bishop, in presenting this gift, told the clergy, &ldquo;that
he hoped to have their prayers at the last judgment.&rdquo; In 1802 the
vineyard was sold, and a Jew who bought it bequeathed it to the civil
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>hospital at Coblence; and &ldquo;thus,&rdquo;
adds the writer we quote, &ldquo;the Israelite nobly revenged his race
on the Archbishop Poppo, who was described in a document of the period
as a friend of Christians and a mortal enemy of Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Traversing a green bank of turf, we arrive in ten minutes at
Niederfells. On the opposite side of the river is Gondorf, and a
farthing ferry deposits us under the walls of the old Stammschloss, or
family house, of the Counts von der Leyen, given at the head of the
chapter.</p>

<p>The last of this time-honoured race, the Count Philip, died in 1830

the little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=

<h3 class="main">THE RED SLEEVE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Chronicle of Gondorf tells us, that in the olden
times the judges of Gondorf used to wear red robes when pronouncing
sentence of death on criminals; and the citizens regarded these robes
with great veneration, considering them to be part and parcel of their
own dignity.</p>
<p>So exemplary were the inhabitants in their behaviour, that many
years passed without the robes being wanted; but at length a criminal
was brought before the Court, and found guilty.</p>
<p>The attendants searched and the judges searched, but no red robes
could be found: time and moths had consumed them, all but one sleeve.
The situation was difficult, for the people would not believe that
justice was done unless they saw the red robes.</p>
<p>A happy thought lit up the face of one Judge, and this was his plan:
each Judge in his turn was to put on the one sleeve, and presenting
himself at the window there deliver his judgment, hiding thus
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>the unrobed part of his person. The idea was
deemed a hit, and put into practice accordingly,&mdash;the populace
being led to believe that the Judges gave their opinions thus
separately, in order that the opinion of one should not bias the minds
of the others. It is added, that the people were very much pleased at
the whole proceeding; but the narrator does not say what the criminal
thought of it, or whether his counsel raised any objection to the
irregularity, if not illegality, of a sentence so pronounced.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE HERMIT OF COBERN.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Robin of Cobern had a beautiful daughter named Else.
Her heart had long been given to the Knight Hans of Sable, but Hans had
offended the Bishop of Tr&egrave;ves, and so was outlawed and
excommunicated.</p>
<p>Hans was obliged to conceal himself, and hastily flying, took refuge
for a long while in solitudes. At length he could no longer endure
being absent from his beloved, so he procured a harp, and set out for
the castle of Cobern, where some festival was then being held. In his
character of Minstrel he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href=
"#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>readily admitted into the castle,
and there he sang a favourite song which Else knew well. The tide of
long-past events rushed so tumultuously back upon fair Else&rsquo;s
mind that she fainted: when she recovered, the Minstrel was gone.
Knowing the hopelessness of his passion, yet unable to conquer it, he
now assumed the habit of a Hermit, and established himself where he
could sometimes see Else as she rode forth on her palfrey.</p>
<p>One evening the Hermit was sitting silently dreaming of days of
happiness, that might have been his in reality, had not his headstrong
will marred his prospects. As thus he sat musing, some robbers drew
near, and not being aware of the Hermit&rsquo;s proximity, one of them
said, &ldquo;Well, be it so; at midnight we meet: the postern gate is
secured, and Else shall be our prize.&rdquo; The robbers were now out
of hearing.</p>
<p>The Hermit, who had little doubt of the meaning of the few words he
had heard, hastened up to the castle in order to warn the Count Robin.
At midnight the robbers came on, and it then was found out that the
postern gate yielded at once to their efforts, which showed that some
treachery was working within; but, spite of both force and fraud, the
robbers were beaten. The Hermit, fighting most valiantly, fell mortally
wounded, and when the fight ended his life was fast ebbing. The Knight
and his daughter stood by him; to the Knight&rsquo;s eyes the valiant
Hermit was dying, but Else wept for her lover. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span></p>
<p>In his hour of death concealment was no longer necessary; and Hans
avowed his identity, and begged that his body might be laid in the
chapel below in the valley, that so in death he should still be near
his loved Else.</p>
<p>Then turning his eyes upon her, who, whatever his faults, had but
one feeling for him that had so long and faithfully loved her, he said,
&ldquo;Farewell, my beloved; in heaven I trust we may meet!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The town of Cobern lies at the foot of a lofty hill, which separates
two valleys that meet in a level plain close to our river. This town
was strongly fortified and defended by the castles, of which the lower
one still exists, and is shown in the vignette on the opposite page.
The drawing is taken from the wall of the upper castle, of which only
one tower and a very few fragments remain.</p>
<p>In the upper castle-yard also stands an elegant chapel; it is
hexagonal, and supported inside by a cluster of pillars, which spring
from the centre, from these start six pointed arches: the interior is
chaste.</p>
<p>This chapel is called by the people the Church of the Templars,
because the castle, in whose walls it stands, was inhabited by some of
the Knights of the Temple after the suppression of their Order. The
proper name of the building is the St. Matthias Chapel, and it was the
principal station of the great pilgrimage which yearly took place from
Coblence to Tr&egrave;ves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>These processions now are less
frequent, but still, in a modified form, they often take place.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e5226width" id="p257"><img src="images/p257.jpg"
alt="" width="626" height="720"></div>
<p>With song and banners waving, these processions wind their way
along, stopping at intervals when before a shrine. The background is
formed by ruined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258"
name="pb258">258</a>]</span>castles, woods, and vineyards; the songs
resound among the hills as in the old days of Germany, when churches
there were none, and God was worshipped under the holy vault of heaven;
where the visible beauties of his works preached the religion of Nature
to those who bad not yet heard Christ&rsquo;s Gospel. Sorrow it is, and
shame, that so much mummery should now be mixed with that which was so
clear and simple when proceeding from His lips.</p>

when the Commander of the army collected his forces and caused
proclamation to be made that the young warrior of Cobern, who had saved
his life at the risk of his own, should stand forth. For a long time no
one came forward, the modest soldier not wishing to make too great a

"pb259">259</a>]</span>answer the question; he stuttered and turned
pale, whereon the Commander ordered him to be placed in fetters.</p>
<p>Then the true Coberner said, the secret mark, only known to our
townspeople, is this: &ldquo;Beneath the high altar in the Church of
Cobern is a spring; this spring bubbles and murmurs while the priest
prays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brave man, whose modesty was highly extolled, was knighted in
place of the young man who had tried to assume a credit not due to him;
and the Knight so made was the first lord of the Castle of Cobern, and
for centuries his family flourished there.</p>
<p>Among his descendants were three sisters, so renowned for their
beauty that they were called &ldquo;The beautiful Trefoil of
Cobern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cobern was the country of the poet Reiff, whose sonnets, of a
<i>triste</i> character, were much prized. The ruins which cover the
country are said to have much influenced, and given this sombre
character to, his writings.</p>
<p>The earliest traditions of this town record that a certain
Lubentius, who was a contemporary of St. Castor of Carden, converted
the ancient inhabitants and performed many miracles; and on one
occasion a dispute having arisen between the canon, Peter of Carden,
and the chaplain, William of Cobern, as to the respective merits of
their two patrons, they fought it out with their fists. William of
Cobern being the biggest and strongest, his cause was the best; so
Saint Castor must rank after Lubentius. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the f&ecirc;te of Lubentius fires were lighted on the surrounding
hills, in emblem of the light of the Gospel, which dispersed the
darkness of Paganism.</p>
<p>This f&ecirc;te took place at the time of the vintage, and the
assisters thereat frequently imitated their champion, William the
Chaplain, and strove to uphold their patron&rsquo;s authority by the
same arguments, the new wine giving life to old quarrels.</p>
<p>The ancient documents relating to Cobern are filled with histories
of the quarrels of the inhabitants one with another, or with those of
the neighbouring places.</p>
<p>The last Knight of Cobern was Johann Lutter, who, being taken
prisoner by the citizens of Coblence, was by them beheaded as a
disturber of the public peace.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Winter Scene.</p>
</div>
<p>Autumn had long been turning the green leaves to gold. A tinge of
yellow first appeared upon the trees; then warmer and brighter grew the
foliage; the vintage came and ended; the corn-harvest was long stored
away, and, like the Roman Empire, more gorgeous in decay than in its
prime. The forest stood crowned with a thousand hues,&mdash;crowned
like a sacrifice of old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=
"#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>prepared for death,&mdash;prepared
to offer up at Nature&rsquo;s shrine the loveliness she gave.</p>
<p>The most gorgeous of the seasons, Autumn is still the saddest. We
look on the fallen leaves and think of friends departed; the useless
heaps that lie around the stems remind us of our lost time, and as the
winter comes age seems stealing on our brows. Who can say, I shall see
spring again? Yet the lesson thus taught us is for our good. Time moves
on and brings us to eternity; therefore, is it not well for man that
Nature warns him of the lapse of Time?</p>
<p>Nor is winter to us an unpleasant or unprofitable period. In winter
we meet again our friends, we gather round our hearths, or meet by
theirs those that we love; old friendships are renewed, old ties are
strengthened, and by the cheerful fireside we repeat tales of old
times,&mdash;tales of days that made our country famous; in gaining
which fame our fathers bled, and we their descendants receive fresh
strength to emulate their deeds.</p>
<p>In the old days, upon our river&rsquo;s bank, the Germans deemed
Christmas more sacred than all other times; for then, they said,
&ldquo;The gods walked upon the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So should it be. At Christmas, we should with the old year bury our
quarrels and our cares; and as our religion teaches, look forward with
a sure hope and certain faith to the new year, which assuredly will
dawn.</p>
<p>In the dark days of Paganism we can well imagine <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>how
men&rsquo;s minds were affected with the gloom of impending winter; but
we are no longer fearful of the coming time, now that we know eternity
is open and that we shall live hereafter.</p>

<p class="first">Between Cobern and Winningen our river makes its last
great bend at a point where a splendid mass of rock towers up on the
left bank. It is the last of the Eifel family of Giants we encounter;
for, beyond Winningen, the scenery on that side becomes softer in
character, smaller hills become undulations, and then, as we get close
to Coblence, these slope into the garden with which the plain is
covered.</p>
<p>The first cluster of houses we encounter after leaving Cobern is
Dieblich. It lies quite back from the stream, and looks anything but a
place that would be especially selected by witches to carry on their
spells and incantations; yet so infected (say the Chronicles) was this
town with witches, that in a short time twenty-five individuals were
burnt there, who all confessed that they were in the habit of meeting
on a neighbouring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265"
name="pb265">265</a>]</span>mountain and worshipping a goat, who was an
incarnation of the Evil One.</p>
<p>They also confessed to having emptied cellars, cursed cattle, raised
storms, destroyed the harvests, and performed all the feats usually
attributed to those unfortunates. The key to the true causes of their
being persecuted lies, perhaps, in the following tale, which, if true,
clears the memory of one witch of Dieblich. Spite, envy, jealousy, or
some other evil passion being, in all probability, the denouncer of the
unfortunate witches in nine cases out of ten.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE FATE OF THE FALSE SWEARER.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An old country Squire who was unmarried, having been
much struck with the appearance of a young girl of Dieblich, determined
to ask her mother to give him the daughter in marriage; so he donned
his best suit and set off.</p>
<p>Now Elsbeth was, as she richly deserved, the belle of the place.
Many and many a head had been broken, and many a tall wine-bottle
emptied, in honour of her. The mother was naturally proud of her
daughter&rsquo;s attractions; indeed, perhaps, as mothers will do, she
rather overrated her merits.</p>
<p>When the Squire rode up to her door, the housewifely frau was busy
preparing the soup, which forms so essential an item of dinner in
Germany. &ldquo;Good day! God be with you!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And
with you also, <span lang="de">mein Herr</span>!&rdquo; replied she;
&ldquo;what brings your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>honourable and
ever-to-be-delighted-in presence to the door of my humble
abode?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then followed the explanation of how the Squire would honour the
buxom Elsbeth by making her his wife; but the frau, nettled at the
Squire&rsquo;s manner, demurred,&mdash;thinking much greater ceremony
should have been observed in asking the hand of the Belle of
Dieblich.</p>
<p>The Squire, not expecting any obstacle, was astonished, then angry;
but at that moment the Beauty entered, and he addressed himself for an
answer to her. She laughed in his face, and averred that he had better
marry her mother; so off rode the Squire, vowing vengeance.</p>
<p>It was, however, a very dear joke for the mother; the Squire hurried
off to Coblence, and there denounced her for a witch. Her friends and
her daughter&rsquo;s lovers came forward to plead in her favour, and
swore that she was a godly old woman, who never had harmed man or
beast.</p>
<p>The false-swearing Squire swore to the contrary, and said these
neighbours of hers were bewitched. The Court, of course believing a
rich man rather than a number of poor ones, ordered the old woman to be
put to the rack; there she confessed sins of which she had never been
guilty, and then she was burnt.</p>
<p>Elsbeth, afraid she should meet the same fate, jumped into the
river.</p>
<p>The wicked Squire rode thoughtfully home, beginning to fear that he
had not gained peace of mind, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267"
href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>though he had had his
revenge. He came in sight of his house, and perceiving a storm was
arising, pushed on with all haste; but it is in vain to fly from our
fate: the lightning flashed out, and his horse starting,
reared,&mdash;then bounding forward, it hurled its rider with force to
the ground. Thus perished the swearer of lies.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>At Winningen the inhabitants are Protestants, and are, says M. de
Bourdelois, &ldquo;distinguished for their religion, language, and
manners, above their Romanist brethren.&rdquo; The vine is nearly the
sole object of culture. Formerly, at Pentecost, a very great f&ecirc;te
was held in the neighbouring forest, at which was collected all the
nobles and knights, burgomasters and aldermen, of the district; the
Lord of Elz gave a huge tun of wine, and the monasteries of St. Martin
and Marienrod sent the eatables, to this gigantic pic-nic.</p>
<p>The people living at this part of our river, especially a little
lower down, near Lay, have been subject to terrible disasters, caused
by the ice which collects here in winter, and then, suddenly breaking
up, floods the whole country. In 1670 the Lahn, being unfrozen, and
swollen with the rain that had fallen in the Taunus range, rushed down,
and sweeping past Coblence, forced its way up the Moselle; thus causing
great icebergs to form in our river, which killed the vines and swept
away orchards, houses, men, beasts, and boats, all in one chaos of
general destruction. In 1709, thrice the ice became melted and then
froze again, each time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href=
"#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>spreading disaster abroad;
Coblence, G&uuml;ls, Lay, and Moselweiss, all severely felt the
effects.</p>
<p>On the hills above Lay is the great drill-ground of Coblence; here
the large body of forces collected in Ehrenbreitstein and Coblence are
man&oelig;uvred. From these heights, too, a remarkable view of the
windings of both Rhine and Moselle may be seen. Stoltzenfels and
Lahneck appear in the distance. Coblence, with long lines of trees
approaching it from all quarters, is just underneath the end of this
promontory of rock; the stone bridge of the Moselle and the boat-bridge
of the Rhine are observed; and the strong fortress of Ehrenbreitstein
is on the opposite side of the Rhine.</p>
<p>Just opposite to G&uuml;ls the Hunsruck mountains recede inland from
the Moselle, and our glad river flows now through a plain. Her course
is nearly finished, her journey is almost accomplished; soon she will
unite her pure spirit and her being with the lordly Rhine. But one
other city standing on her banks has yet to be described; one other
chapter is required to finish the life of our sweet river.</p>

<p>Coblence is situated at the extremity of a level plain watered by
the Moselle and Rhine. It is placed in the angle formed by the junction
of those two rivers. Immediately opposite to the town is the strong
fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, which has the reputation of being
impregnable: it is much doubted whether this fortress would be found as
strong as it is represented to be, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270"
href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>now the art of gunnery has
been so much improved; yet it would certainly be a formidable obstacle
to an attacking army. Coblence itself is strongly fortified, and,
together with Ehrenbreitstein, is garrisoned by about 4000 men. Every
year troops are gathered from other garrisons to the neighbourhood of
Coblence, where they encamp and rehearse all sorts of field
evolutions.</p>
<p>During the earliest period of the Roman Empire a castle was built by
the Romans at the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle. This fortress
fell into the hands of the Franks towards the end of the fifth century.
Gradually a town arose round the fortress, till the space between the
rivers was filled; then two suburbs were built, one called Thal
Coblenz, or Coblence in the Valley&mdash;this was on the right bank of
the Rhine; the other, on the left bank of the Moselle, was called Klein
(little) Coblenz.</p>
<p>After a time the town passed into the possession of the Electors of
Tr&egrave;ves, and they built a palace and fortified it.</p>
<p>The bridge over the Moselle is of Roman origin; but it has
frequently been repaired and partially rebuilt, being subject to great
pressure from the breaking up of the ice on the Moselle, when parts of
Coblence are frequently inundated.</p>
<p>Ehrenbreitstein is built on the site of an ancient Roman tower,
which is described in old maps as &ldquo;<i lang="la">Turris adversus
Germaniam Magnam.</i>&rdquo; The Archbishops of Tr&egrave;ves built a
palace under the walls of this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271"
href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>castle, which was by that
time much enlarged and strengthened. The palace still remains.</p>
<p>During the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, the garrison of Ehrenbreitstein
was reduced to such straits for provisions, that on one occasion, at a
banquet given by the General Commanding to his officers, there were
served up to table sixteen mules, eight dogs, and eighty
rats,&mdash;the latter delicate animals costing twenty sous each: in
addition to these appetising viands, a morsel of bread was served out
to each guest, the flour to make which cost one hundred florins a
bushel.</p>
<p>At the French Revolution, Coblence became the capital of the
Department of the Rhine and Moselle; in 1814 it was given to Prussia,
and is now the capital of the Rhenish Provinces of Prussia, and the
seat of the Government of those Provinces.</p>
<p>Old Coblence was built along the right bank of the Moselle; and its
formerly important suburb of Little Coblence formed with it one town,
immediately connected by the bridge. This bridge was entirely rebuilt
by the celebrated Elector Baldwin of Tr&egrave;ves. It is recorded of
him, that he, by his influence, procured the election of his brother
Henry to the Imperial throne; and after his brother&rsquo;s death he
placed the crown on the head of the Duke of Bavaria: his nephew also
was raised to the throne of Bohemia. He travelled into Italy with the
Emperor, and was on that occasion surrounded by all the chivalry of the
Moselle, the Counts of Elz, Von der Leyen, &amp;c. &amp;c.; in short,
he seems to have equalled in power and magnificence any prince
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>of the age. Yet he was outwitted by Lauretta of
Sponheim.</p>
<p>The bridge was formerly the great centre of gaiety, and the place
most resorted to for exercise and fresh air. Here, on the first day of
the new year, came the chief magistrate to receive tribute from the
different communities that owed him allegiance. The Seigneurs presented
cheeses or a couple of fowls; the Religieuses of Oberwerth a cake, and
those of the Chartreuse a quarter of a hundred of eggs.</p>
<p>On the occasion of this ceremony the senators and magistrates were
allowed to snowball each other; but the bailiffs of the Elector were
not permitted to take a part in this exercise.</p>
<p>A reunion of the authorities also took place on the bridge on the
eve of St. Walpurgis. Then the two burgomasters of Coblence and Little
Coblence arrived, each with a bouquet of lilies freshly gathered.
Lavender and thyme that had been plucked in the woods near Coblence
were also made into bouquets and presented to the wives and daughters
of the principal citizens.</p>
<p>The Walpurgis eve was, according to the old stories, the great day
when the witches assembled from all parts, and rode abroad on the wind,
or else bestrode their housewifely brooms. On one of the annual
reunions upon the bridge a handsome and well-dressed cavalier, holding
a bouquet of the fairest flowers in his hand, was seen wending his way
through the crowd. The eyes of all the young maidens were turned with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>admiring glances upon the cavalier&rsquo;s
handsome face, and great was the jealousy when he stopped before
Lieschen, and presented his bouquet to her. The plaited tails of their
hair became more and more agitated, and meaning looks were exchanged as
Lieschen (who, the men said, was lovely, but who, the girls said, was
an impudent thing) was led by the hand through the crowd, her conductor
being the handsome young stranger; but all their jealousy turned into
pity when, the next morning, it was found that Lieschen had vanished.
Doubtless the young man was a spirit of evil, who had carried her off
to destruction.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>On the day of the dedication of the Church all the young people
danced on the bridge.</p>
<p>The air inhaled on this bridge was held to be of peculiar salubrity,
and an old locksmith, who lived to the age of 120, considered that the
length of his life was entirely owing to his daily walk on the bridge;
and he believed that he might have lived to a much greater age had not
he been prevented one day from taking his accustomed exercise.</p>

<h3 class="main">LEGEND OF THE MOSELLE BRIDGE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A youth stood leaning on the parapet of the Moselle
Bridge. He thought of the numerous stories then rife in those regions,
in which water-spirits played so conspicuous a part. As he silently
gazed, and his young heart yearned for something to
love&mdash;something more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>pure and ethereal than the
Sannchens and Lisbeths of every-day life, a gentle Spirit arose from
the waters&mdash;a Spirit of purity raised by the Spirit of Love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreamer,&rdquo; said the pure Spirit of Water, &ldquo;day
after day and night after night I hear thy sighs and complaints. Thy
tears fall down into the stream, and cause me to pity thee. Nay more, I
could love thy sad heart were I a mortal; but, unlike thee, my poor
youth, I live for ever. I was old when thy fathers were young, and
young shall I be when thou art departed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then broke forth the youth:&mdash;&ldquo;Ever young, ever glorious
art thou! Receive but my love, and I shall be contented to pass from my
mortal existence at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; gravely replied the pure Spirit, &ldquo;thou
thinkest alone of thy love and thy pleasure; know this for thy
good,&mdash;all like thee of mortal race must perform the duties of
their lives before their great reward is gained. If then thou truly
lovest me, and earnestly fulfillest the work appointed thee to do,
faithfully and steadfastly pursuing the straight path in life, then
will I, when thy years are full, receive thee in my arms, for so only
canst thou gain perpetual youth and be a fit associate for even such as
I, who am but a handmaiden of the Queen Moselle, who herself is but one
of the lesser Spirits of the Universe. Go, and be just, and honourable,
and brave; be kind to all, and liberal to the poor; so shalt thou gain
immortal youth and me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275"
href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Spirit was gone, and the bright waves shone in the moonlight;
the youth returned, silent and thoughtful, towards the city.</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>Year after year went by, and every night a solitary figure appeared
at the same spot on the bridge, until the snows of a century crowned
the brows of him who was still in heart but a youth; then his radiant
bride appeared, and the pure-hearted man was wafted away on the bosom
of the pure Water Spirit.</p>
<p>Still on the waters live spirits, beautiful and pure as that which
appeared to the youth, but as yet no other mortal has been found who,
at his death, could claim by his own spotless life an immortal bride.
And if it is the case that scarce one is sinless enough to claim even a
handmaiden among spirits, who shall take his place with those higher
hosts that fill the sky? Who shall dare aspire to the central heaven
itself?</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The Germans of the present time are quite as much given to amusement
as their forefathers were; on every possible occasion they indulge in
pic-nics, dances, fairs, processions, and festivals of all sorts.
Christmas and New-year&rsquo;s Days are perhaps the greatest holidays
in the year, but Carnival time is also universally kept as a
f&ecirc;te, the same as in Italy.</p>
<p>In summer, excursions into the country are the most favourite
amusements; people of all classes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276"
href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>high and low alike, indulge
in these excursions. Some of the villages on the Moselle are
particularly frequented by the people of Coblence. G&uuml;ls,
Moselweiss, and Lay are often crowded with pleasure-seekers of the
poorer class, while the richer are met with at much greater distances;
crowned with wreaths, and laughing and singing, these latter seem to
pass very merry days in the woods, exploring old castles, &amp;c.
Certainly our pic-nics in England are but dull affairs in comparison,
but then our belles are on such occasions better dressed, and it might
hurt their fine clothes if they went romping about as the German girls
do; besides, the impropriety would be shocking.</p>
<p>Coblence is, on the whole, an uninteresting town; it has all the
disadvantage of being a garrison without any particular redeeming
point; the rivers are quite shut out from the town by the
fortifications, and can only be seen by going on to the bridges:
however, the hotels, which are very good, command views of the Rhine
from their windows; and the Belle Vue may be especially mentioned, as
affording most animated scenes to those who occupy its apartments, it
being just opposite to the bridge of boats, where promenaders sun
themselves and military are always crossing and recrossing.</p>
<p>Occasionally the bridge of boats is opened, and steamers, each
tugging a fleet of from two to six, or even seven vessels, beat up the
stream; or else a gigantic floating village of wood comes gliding down,
quite filling the aperture, and looking as if it would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>carry away the whole bridge. It is wonderful the
skill with which these unwieldy rafts are managed.</p>
<p>In the town there are good shops, but not much outward display; and
though, as we have mentioned, not in itself very interesting, yet there
are many and beautiful excursions to be made from it: the society is
said to be agreeable.</p>
<p>Near the junction of the rivers is the church of Saint Castor; it
stands in a large open space, and is a stately and interesting
building: it contains a handsome monument to one of the Electors of
Tr&egrave;ves.</p>
<p>The palace is a large house, not remarkable in any way; in it is a
chapel where English service is performed, as there are a good many
English constantly residing here, as well as the swarms of summer
visitors. Most of the more important buildings are near the Moselle
Bridge, or between it and the church of Saint Castor; that is to say,
they are in the old part of the town.</p>
<p>Near the Castor Church, in the large square, is the monument erected
by the French to commemorate their invasion of Russia. To the
inscription recording the object of raising the monument, the Russian
General who in his turn invaded the Rhine provinces, added&mdash;</p>

<p>The monument is a remarkably ugly lump of stone, which perhaps was
meant for a fountain, but there is no water. <span class=

legends.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Near the Moselle Bridge stood a chapel, piously
dedicated to the Mother of God and her Son. Within the chapel were
images of both Mother and Son.</p>
<p>Here resorted many pilgrims, especially those who suffered under
bodily infirmities: among others came a certain man who was paralytic,
and given over to death by his physicians. With great labour and
trouble he contrived to totter into the chapel by the aid of his
staff.</p>
<p>The pilgrims were singing a hymn, in which the words, &ldquo;Help
us, Maria,&rdquo; occurred frequently. The poor cripple endeavoured to
join in the hymn, but could not, he was so weak.</p>
<p>At last he made a great effort, and the words from his lips were
scarcely audible, but immediately he was relieved: his voice returned
to him, and his limbs became strong again; so that he no longer needed
his staff, which he <i>therefore</i> presented to the chapel.</p>

<h3 class="main">SAINT RITZA.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ritza lived in Little Coblence, just opposite to the
Church of St. Castor. When the bells tolled for morning prayers she
used to walk over the waters to attend at the service, returning by the
same road. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day the waves were high, and the sky full of storms; she
hesitated, and finally gathered a vine-branch, with which she
endeavoured to assist her tottering steps: but faith had deserted her,
and she sank deeper and deeper into the waves&mdash;the prop was
utterly useless; then she thought on her Saviour and prayed for
assistance; instantly she rose again from the waters, and, casting away
the false prop, gained the opposite shore.</p>
<p>After her death Ritza was canonised, and her bones were laid in the
Church of St. Castor.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Another legend also relates how prayer saved those who had faith. It
was on the occasion of a great flood, which submerged a large portion
of the town, the people prayed at a shrine and the waters dispersed;
then on the sands, by the bridge, a figure was found, which all
declared to be the Virgin: it was taken up, and with great pomp placed
in a chapel. In after days this image was again thrown into the water
by the enemies of Coblence, but again it was washed on to the shore;
and, according to the legend, it is now placed near the harbour, where
it watches over the safety of the good city of Coblence.</p>

saved the life of the Emperor Napoleon at the battle of the three
Emperors. Napoleon had advanced too boldly, and was in imminent danger
of being taken prisoner by the Cossacks; if not, which was more likely
still, killed by those wild soldiers. Corporal Spohn having noticed the
desperate position of Napoleon, ran up, and an agreement was hastily
made, by which Spohn mounted the white horse of Napoleon, who escaped
then unnoticed.</p>
<p>The Emperor was saved as a corporal; and the Corporal died as an
emperor.</p>

arrive at Coblence; he, therefore, stood watching most anxiously on the
old bridge over the Moselle. At last the boat which contained her came
into view, and she waved her kerchief to her constant lover.</p>
<p>Alas! before he could clasp her the boat overturned, and Bertha was
struggling beneath an arch of the bridge. Henry rushed down to save
her, but just as he arrived at the edge of the water she uttered his
name and went down.</p>
<p>Marking the place, Henry dashed in and seized on her loosened hair,
which floated on the surface of the agitated river: thus he succeeded
in saving her life, and gaining from the stream a loving wife.

<h3 class="main">THE POET&rsquo;S DEATHBED.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Max of Schenkendorf is well known in Germany by his
songs on those combats for liberty, of which so many took place in his
Fatherland. The Poet was in the last stage of consumption.</p>
<p>It was the morning of his birthday. Max lay sleeping in bed, but his
wife had arisen, and was now busy adorning his chamber with flowers in
honour of the Poet&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>Having arranged all the bouquets, she made up a garland of
evergreens, which she placed softly on the brow of the sleeper,
fervently praying that it might become an emblem of new laurels which
her husband should gain in this new year of his life.</p>
<p>As she leant over him to place the wreath on his head, she tenderly
kissed the lips of the sleeper, and softly she murmured, &ldquo;Oh,
would I could kiss you to health!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decorations now were completed, and softly the wife stept from
the husband&rsquo;s bedside, softly she passed from the chamber.</p>
<p>But as she went out an unbidden guest entered there&mdash;Death came
over the threshold and took the wife&rsquo;s place. Death strode up to
the bed and laid his chill hand on the feverish brow of the sleeper:
closer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>and closer then wound those arms which
supplanted for ever those of the wife&mdash;closer and closer, until
icy and rigid became the frame of the Poet.</p>
<p>An hour slowly passed, and the fond wife re-entered. Max now was
lying a corpse, crowned with the wreath that she had placed upon his
living brow. In agony she cried, &ldquo;Wake, O wake, my own, my
beloved! Depart not from her who lives but in thee! One word, but
one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile was on his lips, but the spirit was gone, leaving only its
imprint on the cold clay.</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weep, not, O woman!&rdquo; said his spirit to her,
&ldquo;weep not for the clay that lies here; the shackles are broken;
what earth could not hold, nor love longer detain, can neither be
fettered by Death: the body is dead, but the soul lives for ever; it
lives in thy love and thy heart; it lives in the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This is the last of our legends; and with a few remarks on the
habits and customs of the part of Germany near our river we will come
to the conclusion of our last chapter. Not without regret shall we end;
for it is a pleasant task, in these cold short days of winter, to
record that which brings to our remembrance the long bright days of
summer; especially as that summer was spent among such lovely
scenes.</p>
<p>The Germans bear the character of being an honest, hardworking,
intelligent people, very domestic in their habits, even to
exclusiveness; the different classes <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>assort together less
than they do in England, but passing communication is freer and less
constrained.</p>
<p>During the many weeks we passed on the Moselle, and in a former
excursion on our river, we never once encountered a family of tourists
of the upper class of Germans. At Bad Bertrich there were some, but
they were there because it is a watering-place&mdash;not because it is
beautiful; and as soon as the season was over away they all went, as if
they were afraid to remain at a Bad out of the fashionable season,
although the weather was much more suitable for country pursuits than
it had been during the season.</p>
<p>This same fashion arrays the dumpy young ladies of Germany in a most
strange deformity of inflated petticoats. Bad enough as these things
are in England and France, in Germany they are much worse.</p>
<p>The gentlemen are, in general, agreeable, and more truly polite than
the French; but French ladies certainly have the advantage over their
sisters in Germany.</p>
<p>The poorer classes still bear the stamp of the old German character.
They are frugal, hard-working, honest, and cheerful. They are
well-mannered and well-informed for their class. They also exhibit
considerable neatness and taste in their dress. No pleasanter object
can be met in a summer-day&rsquo;s ramble than a group of the
<i>m&auml;dchen</i>, with their hair neatly folded, smooth on the brow
and plaited behind, with the smart embroidered cloth or velvet
head-dress, and the gilt paper-cutter passed through the hair; neat
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>shoes and blue stockings are shown by the
sensible length of the petticoats, and a gay handkerchief sets off the
firm bust. Their figures are lithe and upright, though somewhat thick
and substantial. The paper-cutter in the head is supposed to represent
a nail of the Cross.</p>
<p>As housewives, the Germans are doubtless unsurpassed by any other
nation; the houses are clean, the stoves shine brightly, and they are
for ever washing clothes in the river. We cannot applaud the way in
which they cook their meat generally, but their puddings are admirable.
At Cochem our landlady used to send us up souffl&eacute;d puddings that
would have done credit to the Palais Royal. On the Moselle the
old-fashioned spinning-wheel is to be seen in every village, and
knitting is always taken in hand when walking or superintending
household affairs.</p>
<p>Singing is constantly heard in the evening, and many of the little
coteries in the townlets by our river&rsquo;s side subscribe to hire a
piano from Coblence or Tr&egrave;ves, and by the aid of its music they
make lively the long hours of darkness in winter.</p>
<p>The priests seem respected, and on amicable terms with all classes,
but generally they do not hold the same social position that they do in
this country.</p>
<p>If the traveller on the Moselle is himself not over-exacting, and
ready to meet civility half-way, he will find all those he encounters
polite and pleasant, and he cannot fail of spending an agreeable time
on the banks of our charming river. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Roman poet Ausonius, who about the year <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 370, when passing through the dense forests that
covered all Germany, suddenly came out on the Moselle near Neumagen,
was so struck with the beauty of the river that he explored its course,
and then wrote a poem thereon. The palaces and the buildings he
mentions have all passed away, but the natural beauties remain; and the
old castles that at the present time adorn the tops of the hills quite
make up for the towers that are gone.</p>
<p>Now, as then, the vine grows luxuriantly over the cliffs, the
peaceful river flows calmly on; and the people dwelling on its banks
are simple, loyal, and brave.</p>
<p>We have now reached and described Coblence, and with Coblence ends
the Life of the Moselle. We have sat with her beneath the forest shade
that shelters her birthplace in the Vosges mountains; we have day after
day wandered by her side as she bounded along in all the freshness of
her youth, or as, in later days, she floated on majestic in her beauty;
we have slept night after night, lulled by the ripple of her waters; we
have climbed among her mountains and her forests; we have mused or sung
amidst her ruins; we have dreamt of other days, of olden times, of
things that come not again save in such dreams; we have also, it is to
be hoped, in some measure, profited by our communion with the great
heart of Nature,&mdash;something, we trust, we have learnt of that
inner life which makes the very stones and earth preach to us of their
Divine origin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>By the Moselle we have found flowers growing, beautiful in their
forms and colours, but more beautiful in their uncultured wildness; we
have listened to the songs of the gay birds as we rested in the woods;
the clouds have fleeted through the pure blue vault, rain has freshened
earth and sun has ripened her fruits: all these, and many other
incidents, have striven to teach us to love and reverence the great
heart of Nature; that heart which, if the Painter, with all his skill
of colour or of handiwork, fail to express, he sinks back into the mere
copyist; if the Poet feel it not or love it not, his bark is stranded
on a barren shore; and what would music be without it?</p>
<p>If, then, the Moselle has whispered or suggested to us aught of this
heart, this inner life of Nature, let us preserve it within us pure and
beautiful, as all things in Nature are; so shall our summer&rsquo;s
tour have not been made in vain, nor useless been the life of the
Moselle.</p>
<p>Standing at that spot where the Moselle and Rhine are met, we now
take leave of our dear river.</p>
<p>Night is in the heavens, the still cold night of winter; the stars
look down upon us with their eyes of love; the great fortress of
Ehrenbreitstein looms hugely over the Rhine stream, telling of war and
horrid strife, but on the shore of the Moselle rises a fair church,
telling of peace. The fortress shall crumble and decay, but the church
shall, in the end, remain when all else has passed away. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p>The light of the stars falls coldly on the waters; the air is chill
and frosty; if we look further, we perceive in the distance forms of
beauty floating on: dark is the night around, but the stars are bright.
So with us, all is often dark and dreary; the very light we have, seems
cold, but if we search earnestly into Nature&rsquo;s heart, and follow
her guidance, she will lead us where those faint shining stars become
great worlds of light; and they, the footstools of still higher realms,
shall guide us to Heaven itself.</p>
